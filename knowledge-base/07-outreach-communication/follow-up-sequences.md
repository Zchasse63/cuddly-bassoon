# Follow-Up Sequences for Seller Leads: Complete Templates and Strategies

## Quick Reference

- **80% of wholesale deals close after 5 or more follow-up touches**—most wholesalers quit after 2
- The average motivated seller needs **45-90 days** from first contact to contract signing
- **New leads require a minimum 7-touch sequence** spread across the first 30 days
- Mix channels strategically: phone calls, texts, emails, voicemails, and direct mail
- **Automation handles volume; personal touches close deals**—use both intentionally
- Track open rates, response rates, and engagement scores to adjust your approach
- **Never stop following up on leads with equity**—reduce frequency but maintain contact
- Life events and market shifts create re-activation opportunities for dormant leads
- Content variation prevents message fatigue and keeps your outreach fresh
- A $10,000 assignment fee divided by 20 follow-ups equals **$500 per touch**—follow-up pays

## The Critical Importance of Follow-Up

Follow-up separates successful wholesalers from struggling ones. The statistics are undeniable: **80% of deals require five or more touches** before the seller agrees to meet or accept an offer. Yet most wholesalers abandon leads after just one or two attempts.

Consider this math: If you generate 100 leads monthly at $15 per lead ($1,500 total), and you close 2 deals at $10,000 each, your ROI is healthy. But if proper follow-up increases your close rate from 2% to just 4%, you've doubled revenue without spending another dollar on marketing.

### Why Sellers Don't Respond Immediately

Motivated sellers hesitate for legitimate reasons:
- **Timing isn't right yet**—facing foreclosure in 6 months, not 6 days
- **Emotional attachment**—need time to accept selling below market
- **Competing priorities**—dealing with divorce, probate, or health issues
- **Price shopping**—comparing offers from multiple investors
- **Trust building**—skeptical of "we buy houses" companies

Your follow-up sequence addresses each hesitation systematically, positioning you as the professional who cares enough to stay in touch.

## Follow-Up Sequence Templates

### New Lead: 7-Touch Sequence (First 30 Days)

This sequence applies to every new inbound or outbound lead who hasn't clearly disqualified themselves.

**Day 1: Immediate Response**
- Channel: Phone call + text message
- Timing: Within 5 minutes of lead capture
- Purpose: Establish contact while your marketing is fresh
- Script: "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name]. You requested information about selling your property at [Address]. I'd love to learn more about your situation. When's a good time for a quick 10-minute conversation?"

**Day 2: Value-Add Follow-Up**
- Channel: Email
- Purpose: Provide value and demonstrate expertise
- Content: "I pulled some comparable sales data for your neighborhood. Properties like yours have sold between $X and $Y recently. Would this information be helpful as you consider your options?"

**Day 4: Alternative Contact Attempt**
- Channel: Phone call (different time of day)
- Purpose: Catch them at a better time
- Note: Leave a voicemail if no answer—brief, specific, with callback number

**Day 7: Text Check-In**
- Channel: Text message
- Purpose: Lower-commitment engagement
- Message: "Hi [Name], just checking in on [Address]. Still thinking about selling? No pressure—happy to answer any questions whenever you're ready."

**Day 14: Market Update**
- Channel: Email
- Purpose: Stay relevant with useful information
- Content: Share a relevant market update, news about their neighborhood, or a recent sale

**Day 21: Social Proof Touch**
- Channel: Text or voicemail
- Purpose: Build credibility through results
- Message: "Just helped a homeowner on [Nearby Street] close in 12 days. Thought of you—still have your property on my list. Let me know if circumstances have changed."

**Day 30: Decision Point**
- Channel: Phone call
- Purpose: Direct conversation about timeline
- Approach: "I wanted to follow up before closing out your file. Are you still considering selling, or has your situation changed?"

### Warm Lead: Deeper Engagement Sequence

Warm leads have engaged—responded to outreach, provided information, or expressed interest without committing. This sequence runs **days 30-90** or until conversion.

**Weekly touches rotating through:**

**Week 1: Problem-Solution Call**
- Channel: Phone
- Focus: Address their specific concern (timeline, price, condition)
- Example: "You mentioned the repairs seemed overwhelming. I wanted to share how we handled a similar situation last month..."

**Week 2: Case Study Email**
- Channel: Email
- Content: Detailed story of a similar seller you helped
- Include: Timeline, process, outcome, testimonial if available

**Week 3: Market Insight Text**
- Channel: Text
- Content: Brief, relevant market information
- Example: "FYI—interest rates dropped again. More buyers in the market if you decide to sell. Just keeping you posted!"

**Week 4: Personal Check-In**
- Channel: Handwritten note (mailed)
- Content: Brief, genuine message
- Example: "Been thinking about your situation with the inherited property. No pressure—just wanted you to know I'm here when you're ready."

**Repeat this 4-week cycle** with fresh content until conversion or clear disqualification.

### Dead Lead Revival: Quarterly Re-Engagement

Dead leads haven't responded in 90+ days. They're not dead—they're dormant. **27% of "dead" leads eventually convert** with persistent follow-up.

**Quarterly Touch Sequence:**

**Quarter 1 Revival:**
- Channel: Direct mail (handwritten-style card)
- Message: "Hi [Name], I reached out a few months ago about [Address]. Wanted to check if your situation has changed. Sometimes timing just needs to be right. I'm here if you need me."

**Quarter 2 Revival:**
- Channel: Text message
- Message: "Quick question—still own [Address]? Market's shifted since we last talked. Might be worth a fresh conversation."

**Quarter 3 Revival:**
- Channel: Email with market report
- Content: Updated CMA or market analysis for their property
- Subject line: "[Address] - Updated Market Value"

**Quarter 4 Revival:**
- Channel: Phone call
- Script: "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name]. We spoke [timeframe] ago about [Address]. I'm doing my annual review of properties in [Area]—wanted to see if selling is back on your radar."

### Lost Deal Win-Back Sequence

Lost deals—sellers who chose another buyer or decided not to sell—deserve specific re-engagement.

**Immediate (Day 1 after loss):**
- Channel: Phone call or text
- Message: "Totally understand your decision. If anything changes or doesn't work out with your current plan, I'm a phone call away. Best of luck!"

**30 Days Post-Loss:**
- Channel: Text
- Purpose: Check if their chosen path worked out
- Message: "Hi [Name], hope everything went smoothly with [their decision]. If you ever need a backup option, my offer stands."

**60 Days Post-Loss:**
- Channel: Email
- Content: Soft touch with market update
- No direct ask—just staying visible

**90 Days Post-Loss:**
- Channel: Phone call
- Script: "Hey [Name], it's [Your Name]. Just doing a quarterly check-in on properties I've evaluated. How'd everything work out with [Address]?"

**Note:** 15-20% of lost deals come back. Their other buyer's financing falls through, their listing expires, or their "I'll just keep it" plan becomes unsustainable.

## Multi-Channel Follow-Up Integration

Effective follow-up uses multiple channels strategically:

| Channel | Best For | Response Rate | Effort Level |
|---------|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Phone call | Urgent/motivated leads | 8-12% connect | High |
| Text message | Quick check-ins | 35-45% response | Low |
| Email | Detailed information | 15-25% open | Low |
| Voicemail | Leaving clear callbacks | N/A | Medium |
| Direct mail | Standing out | 2-5% response | High |
| Ringless voicemail | Volume outreach | 10-15% listen | Low |

**Integration Strategy:**
- Lead phone call attempts with text backup
- Follow meaningful conversations with email summaries
- Use direct mail for high-equity leads who go dark
- Reserve ringless voicemail for re-activation campaigns

## Automation vs. Personal Touch Decisions

### Automate These:
- Initial text response to new leads
- Email drip sequences for long-term nurture
- Appointment reminders
- Quarterly check-in emails to dead leads
- Birthday/anniversary messages

### Personalize These:
- First live conversation
- Post-appointment follow-up
- Negotiation discussions
- Objection handling
- Seller-specific problem solving
- Contract signing and closing coordination

**The Rule:** Automate to maintain contact, personalize to close deals. If a seller responds to an automated message, immediately switch to personal communication.

## Tracking Engagement and Adjusting

### Key Metrics to Monitor:

**Email Engagement:**
- Open rate benchmark: 25-35%
- Click rate benchmark: 3-5%
- If below benchmarks: Improve subject lines, send times, or content relevance

**Text Engagement:**
- Response rate benchmark: 35-45%
- If below: Shorten messages, improve calls-to-action, or adjust timing

**Call Connect Rate:**
- Benchmark: 8-12%
- If below: Vary call times, use local caller ID, or try different days

### Lead Scoring Adjustments

Assign points based on engagement:
- Email opened: +1 point
- Link clicked: +3 points
- Text response: +5 points
- Call answered: +10 points
- Appointment set: +25 points

**Leads scoring 15+ points** move to warm lead sequences with increased frequency. Leads with zero engagement after 90 days move to quarterly nurture.

## When to Stop Following Up

Stop active follow-up when:
- Seller explicitly requests removal ("Stop contacting me")
- Property sells (verify through public records)
- Seller is deceased with no identifiable heirs
- Property has no equity and no creative deal potential
- You've confirmed wrong contact information with no correction available

**Never stop following up** on leads with:
- 20%+ equity
- Motivated circumstances (even if timing isn't right)
- Engagement history (previous responses or meetings)
- High-value properties ($50K+ potential profit)

Reduce to quarterly for dormant leads; maintain indefinitely for high-potential opportunities.

## Re-Activation Triggers

Certain events create new motivation. Monitor for these triggers and reach out immediately:

**Life Events:**
- Divorce filings (public records)
- Death in family (obituaries, probate filings)
- Job changes (LinkedIn updates)
- New tax liens or code violations

**Market Changes:**
- Interest rate shifts affecting affordability
- New development announcements in area
- Seasonal market activity (spring buying season)
- Local employer closures or relocations

**Property-Specific:**
- Listing expires on MLS
- Property listed for sale by owner
- Visible deferred maintenance (drive-by)
- Neighbor sales creating comps

**Re-Activation Script:**
"Hi [Name], I noticed [trigger event]. I know we talked a while back about [Address]. Sometimes situations change—wanted to check if this affects your plans at all."

## Follow-Up Content Variation

Never send the same message twice. Rotate through these content types:

1. **Market updates** - Comps, trends, neighborhood news
2. **Problem-solving** - Address their specific objection
3. **Social proof** - Recent deals, testimonials, case studies
4. **Educational** - Process explanation, myth-busting
5. **Personal** - Genuine check-in, no pitch
6. **Urgency** - Market timing, buyer availability
7. **Value-add** - Free CMA, repair estimates, referrals

**Example Rotation for 6-Month Sequence:**
- Month 1: Market update + problem-solving
- Month 2: Social proof + educational
- Month 3: Personal check-in
- Month 4: Market update + urgency
- Month 5: Value-add + social proof
- Month 6: Personal check-in + soft ask

## Examples

### Example 1: New Lead to Contract (32-Day Journey)

**Lead source:** Direct mail response
**Property:** 123 Oak Street, inherited property with deferred maintenance
**Timeline breakdown:**

| Day | Touch | Channel | Outcome |
|-----|-------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Immediate response | Call + text | Left voicemail, text delivered |
| 2 | Value email | Email | Opened, no reply |
| 4 | Second call | Phone | No answer |
| 7 | Check-in text | Text | **Replied:** "Still thinking about it" |
| 8 | Engagement call | Phone | **Connected:** Set appointment for Day 12 |
| 12 | Property visit | In-person | Made offer of $85,000 |
| 14 | Follow-up call | Phone | Seller thinking, wants to discuss with sibling |
| 21 | Social proof text | Text | Shared similar deal success |
| 25 | Decision call | Phone | **Verbal acceptance** |
| 32 | Contract signing | In-person | Signed at $87,000 |

**Total touches:** 9
**Assignment fee:** $12,500
**Cost per touch:** $1,389

### Example 2: Dead Lead Revival Success

**Original contact:** March 2024
**Property:** 456 Pine Avenue, pre-foreclosure
**Original outcome:** Seller said "not ready yet"

**Revival sequence:**
- June 2024: Quarterly postcard sent → No response
- September 2024: Text message → No response  
- December 2024: Email with market report → **Opened twice**
- December 2024 (Day 3): Follow-up call → **Connected**

Seller's original forbearance ended. Now 60 days from foreclosure sale. Closed deal in 18 days, $9,200 assignment fee.

**Time from first contact to close:** 9 months
**Total touches over 9 months:** 14
**Effective hourly rate for follow-up time:** $460/hour

## Common Mistakes

1. **Giving up after 2-3 attempts** - The data proves most deals need 5+ touches; persist professionally

2. **Identical messages** - Sellers notice when you copy-paste; vary your content and approach

3. **Wrong channel insistence** - If someone never answers calls, switch to text; adapt to their preference

4. **Robotic automation** - Fully automated sequences feel impersonal; blend automation with genuine touches

5. **No tracking system** - Following up without CRM tracking leads to duplicate messages or missed opportunities

6. **Premature removal** - Removing leads after non-response wastes marketing investment; reduce frequency instead

7. **Ignoring engagement signals** - When someone opens your email five times, call them immediately

8. **Selling in every message** - Some touches should be pure value with no ask—build relationship equity

9. **Poor timing** - Calling at 8 AM on Monday or 5 PM on Friday decreases connect rates; test optimal times

10. **No clear call-to-action** - Every message needs a specific next step—even if it's just "reply with questions"
