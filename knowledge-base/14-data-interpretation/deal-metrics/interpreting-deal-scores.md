# Interpreting Deal Scores

## What Deal Scores Tell You

Deal scores provide an overall assessment of deal quality, combining property value, seller motivation, market conditions, and potential profitability into a single metric.

## Deal Score Components

### Typical Score Breakdown
```

- Seller motivation: 18/25 (motivation signals)
- Market conditions: 15/20 (velocity, trends)
- Profit potential: 12/15 (MAO room)
- Risk factors: 8/10 (title, condition)
```

### Component Weights
| Component | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Value opportunity | 30% | Gap between price and ARV |
| Seller motivation | 25% | Likelihood of acceptance |
| Market conditions | 20% | Exit ease and timing |

## Using Deal Scores

### Quick Screening
```
If Deal Score < 50 → Likely not worth pursuing
If Deal Score 50-70 → Review details, may need negotiation
If Deal Score > 70 → Worth full analysis
```

### Prioritizing Pipeline
Sort leads by deal score to focus on:
1. Highest scores first
2. Balance score with expected close rate
3. Consider deal size * score for dollar-weighted priority

### Negotiation Strategy
| Score | Opening Strategy |
|-------|------------------|
| 80+ | Offer near MAO (competitive) |
| 70-79 | Start 10% below MAO |
| 60-69 | Start 15% below MAO |
| 50-59 | Start 20%+ below MAO |
| < 50 | May not be viable at any price |

## Score Dynamics

### What Improves Scores
- Price reduction by seller
- New motivation signals discovered
- Market conditions improve
- Risk factors resolved

### What Reduces Scores
- Price increase
- Discovered issues (title, condition)
- Market slowdown
- Competition for property

### Track Score Changes
```
Initial Score: 62
After price drop: 71
After motivation call: 75
Current: 75 → Worth pursuing

Trend: ↑ Improving opportunity
```

## Component Analysis

### When Components Disagree

**High value, low motivation:**
```
Strong discount but seller not motivated
Strategy: May need time, set long-term follow-up
Risk: Seller may not accept reasonable offer
```

**High motivation, low value:**
```
Motivated seller but poor economics
Strategy: Verify ARV, look for hidden value
Risk: Deal may not pencil at any price
```

**Good overall, high risk:**
```
Deal looks good but title/condition concerns
Strategy: Address risk before proceeding
Risk: May fall apart during due diligence
```

### Component-Based Actions

| Weak Component | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| Value | Negotiate harder, verify ARV |
| Motivation | Build rapport, find pain points |
| Market | Plan for longer exit, adjust MAO |
| Profit | Reduce offer, cut fees |
| Risk | Investigate and mitigate |

## Score Confidence

### High Confidence Scores
- All data points available
- Recent, verified data
- Multiple confirming signals

### Low Confidence Scores
- Missing data points
- Old/stale data
- Conflicting signals

**When confidence is low:**
- Investigate uncertain components
- Use conservative interpretation
- Don't rely solely on score

## Score Comparison

### Comparing Multiple Deals
```
Property A: Score 78
Property B: Score 72
Property C: Score 68

Priority: A > B > C

But also consider:
- Deal size (larger = more important)
- Effort required
- Timeline to close
```

### Normalizing for Deal Size
```
Dollar-weighted priority = Deal Score × Expected Profit

Property A: 78 × $12,000 = 936,000
Property B: 72 × $18,000 = 1,296,000
Property C: 68 × $8,000 = 544,000

Adjusted Priority: B > A > C
```

## Score History

### Why Track Score History
- See if opportunities are improving
- Identify properties trending toward deals
- Know when to re-engage cold leads

### Score Alerts
```
"Alert me when any property in my pipeline:
- Increases score by 10+ points
- Crosses above 70
- Has new motivation signals"
```
