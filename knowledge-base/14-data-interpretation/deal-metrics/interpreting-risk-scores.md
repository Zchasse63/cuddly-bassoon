Risk Breakdown:
- Title Risk: 15/30 (Moderate - tax lien exists)
- Seller Risk: 5/25 (Low - single owner, cooperative)
- Property Risk: 5/20 (Low - good condition)

```

### Score Interpretation

| Total Risk Score | Level | Action |
|------------------|-------|--------|
| 0-20 | Low Risk | Proceed confidently |
| 21-40 | Moderate Risk | Proceed with awareness |
| 41-60 | Elevated Risk | Investigate concerns |
| 61-80 | High Risk | Address before proceeding |
| 81-100 | Very High Risk | Likely not worth pursuing |

## Using Risk Scores

### Go/No-Go Decision

**Low Risk (0-20):** Proceed normally
- Standard due diligence
- Normal timeline
- Confident budgeting

**Moderate Risk (21-40):** Proceed with caution
- Enhanced due diligence
- Address identified risks
- Add contingency buffer

**Elevated Risk (41-60):** Evaluate carefully
- Deep dive on risk factors
- Quantify cost/impact
- Require larger margin

**High Risk (61-80):** Reconsider
- Significant concerns present
- May require risk mitigation
- Only if discount compensates

**Very High Risk (81+):** Generally avoid
- Multiple serious concerns
- High probability of failure
- Exception: distressed pricing

### Risk-Adjusted Pricing

**Adjust MAO for Risk:**
```
Base MAO: $150,000
Risk score: 45 (Elevated)
Risk discount: 5%
Adjusted MAO: $142,500
```

**Risk Discount Table:**
| Risk Score | MAO Adjustment |
|------------|----------------|
| 0-20 | No adjustment |
| 21-40 | -2-3% |
| 41-60 | -5-8% |
| 61-80 | -10-15% |

- Permit issues: +10-25 points
```

## Risk Score Trends

### Improving Risk Score
Watch for:
- Liens being paid off
- Title issues resolved
- Seller becoming cooperative
- Market improving

### Worsening Risk Score
Watch for:
- New liens filed
- Seller unresponsive
- New title issues discovered
- Market declining

### Track Over Time
```
Initial risk score: 55
After title search: 42 (tax lien confirmed)
After lien agreement: 28 (payoff plan)
At closing: 15 (resolved)

Trend: Improving → Proceed
```

## Risk vs Reward

### Calculate Risk-Adjusted Return
```
Expected profit: $15,000
Risk score: 40 (Moderate)
Estimated failure rate: 15%
Expected value: $15,000 × 85% = $12,750

Compare to:
Safe deal: $10,000 profit, 5% failure rate
Expected value: $10,000 × 95% = $9,500

Risk-adjusted: Moderate risk deal is better
```

### When to Accept Higher Risk
- Significantly higher profit potential
- Risk can be mitigated
- You have capacity for loss
- Timeline isn't critical

### When to Avoid Risk
- Risk cannot be mitigated
- Profit margin is thin
- You can't afford failure
- Other opportunities available
