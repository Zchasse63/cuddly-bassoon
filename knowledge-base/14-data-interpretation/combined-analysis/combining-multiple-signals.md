# Combining Multiple Signals

## Why Combine Signals?

No single data point tells the whole story. The best deal analysis combines:
- Property valuation data (RentCast)
- Permit/renovation history (Shovels)
- Owner motivation signals
- Market conditions
- Comparable sales

## The Signal Matrix

### Building a Complete Picture

| Data Layer | Source | Key Questions |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| Value | RentCast AVM | What's it worth? |
| Condition | Permits + Inspection | What work is needed? |
| Owner | Records + Signals | Are they motivated? |
| Market | Market Data | How fast will it sell? |
| Competition | Listings | What else is available? |

### Combining for Deal Scoring

The platform combines signals into a deal score (1-10):
