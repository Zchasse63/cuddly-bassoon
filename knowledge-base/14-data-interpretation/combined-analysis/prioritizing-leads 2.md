# Prioritizing Leads

## Why Prioritization Matters

With limited time and resources, focusing on the highest-potential leads maximizes your deal flow. Systematic prioritization ensures you don't miss opportunities while avoiding time wasters.

## Lead Scoring Framework

### Basic Priority Score Formula
```
Priority Score = (Motivation × 0.35) + (Deal Quality × 0.30) +
                 (Accessibility × 0.20) + (Timing × 0.15)
```

### Score Components

**Motivation Score (35% weight):**
- Absentee status
- Equity level
- Ownership duration
- Distress signals
- Life events

**Deal Quality Score (30% weight):**
- ARV vs price gap
- Repair level
- Market conditions
- Exit ease

**Accessibility Score (20% weight):**
- Contact info available
- Response to outreach
- Decision maker identified
- Communication ease

**Timing Score (15% weight):**
- Urgency indicators
- Time constraints
- Competitive situation
- Market timing

## Scoring Examples

### High Priority Lead
```
Property: 123 Main St
Motivation: 85 (out-of-state, 60% equity, 12yr owner)
Deal Quality: 75 (asking 62% of ARV, good market)
Accessibility: 80 (phone verified, answered once)
Timing: 70 (wants to sell before year end)

Priority Score = (85×0.35) + (75×0.30) + (80×0.20) + (70×0.15)
              = 29.75 + 22.5 + 16 + 10.5
              = 78.75

Tier: 2 (Warm, nearly Hot)
Action: Prioritize follow-up this week
```

### Medium Priority Lead
```
Property: 456 Oak Ave
Motivation: 65 (local absentee, moderate equity)
Deal Quality: 60 (asking 68% of ARV)
Accessibility: 50 (phone unknown, mailing only)
Timing: 40 (no urgency)

Priority Score = (65×0.35) + (60×0.30) + (50×0.20) + (40×0.15)
              = 22.75 + 18 + 10 + 6
              = 56.75

Tier: 3 (Cool)
Action: Add to nurture sequence
```

## Daily Prioritization Process

### Morning Review
```
1. Check new leads from overnight
2. Score and tier new leads
3. Identify Tier 1 leads for immediate action
4. Plan Tier 2 follow-ups for today
```

### Priority Actions
```
Priority Order:
1. Hot leads (immediate callbacks)
2. Scheduled appointments
3. Warm lead follow-ups
4. New lead outreach
5. Cool/cold nurturing
```

### Weekly Reprioritization
```
Every Monday:
1. Review all active leads
2. Update scores with new info
3. Promote/demote between tiers
4. Archive stale leads
5. Set week's priorities
```

## Pipeline Capacity

### Maximum Active Leads by Tier
```
Tier 1 (Hot): 10-15 (intensive attention)
Tier 2 (Warm): 30-50 (regular attention)
Tier 3 (Cool): 100-200 (systematic nurture)
Tier 4 (Cold): 500+ (automated nurture)
```

### When Pipeline is Full
```
If Tier 1 is full (15+):
- Focus 100% on hot leads
- Move slower on new leads
- Don't add more until closed/moved

If Tier 2 is full (50+):
- Prioritize within tier
- Be more selective on new additions
- Push for tier upgrades
```

## Score Updates

### When to Rescore
- New information received
- Contact attempt completed
- Time passed (weekly for active)
- Market conditions changed
- Competitive situation changed

### Score Trajectory
```
Track score over time:
Lead 123: 55 → 62 → 68 → 75

Trending up = Increasing priority
Trending down = Decreasing priority
Flat = Reassess or archive
```

## Prioritization Mistakes

### Common Errors
| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Only working hot leads | Missing warm opportunities | Balance pipeline |
| Working everything equally | Inefficient | Strict tiering |
| Not updating scores | Stale priorities | Weekly reviews |
| Ignoring deal quality | Chasing unmotivated leads | Weight deal economics |
| Over-weighting recency | Missing aged opportunities | Score all factors |

### Bias to Avoid
- **Recency bias:** New isn't always better
- **Sunk cost:** Don't over-pursue just because you've invested time
- **Availability:** Don't prioritize just because they answered
- **Deal size:** Small deals can be faster wins

## Automation Tips

### Automated Scoring
```
"Score all new leads and sort by priority"
"Alert me when any lead crosses into Tier 1"
"Auto-assign Tier 3-4 to nurture sequences"
```

### Automated Actions
```
Tier 1 Alert: SMS notification to you
Tier 2 New: Add to this week's call list
Tier 3 New: Add to email sequence
Tier 4 New: Add to mail sequence
```
