# Interpreting ARV Estimates

## What ARV Tells You

After Repair Value (ARV) is the estimated market value of a property after renovations are complete. Understanding how to interpret this number is crucial for wholesale deal analysis.

## Reading ARV Results

When you get an ARV estimate, you'll see:

```
Estimated ARV: $285,000
Range: $265,000 - $305,000
Confidence: 82%
Price/SqFt: $185
Comparables: 5
```

### Primary Estimate

The main ARV number is the most likely value based on comparable sales. Use this for:
- Initial deal screening
- Quick MAO calculations
- Buyer price expectations

### Price Range

The low-high range indicates uncertainty:

| Range Width | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| ±5% | High confidence, use primary estimate |
| ±10% | Moderate confidence, consider using low end |
| ±15%+ | Low confidence, verify with additional research |

**Conservative approach**: Use the low end of the range for MAO calculations.

### Confidence Score

| Score | What It Means | Action |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| 80%+ | Strong estimate | Use confidently |
| 60-79% | Moderate estimate | Verify key comps |
| 40-59% | Weak estimate | Get additional data |
| Below 40% | Unreliable | Do manual comp analysis |

### Price Per Square Foot

Compare $/sqft to market averages:

| Comparison | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| Higher than market | Unique features, premium location |
| At market | Normal property |
| Lower than market | May indicate issues or opportunity |

## Adjusting ARV

### For Property Condition

The AVM assumes average condition. Adjust for actual condition:

| Condition | Adjustment |
|-----------|------------|
| Turn-key ready | +5-10% |
| Good, minor updates | No adjustment |
| Dated but functional | -5% |
| Needs full renovation | -10-15% |
| Major structural issues | -15-25% |

### For Market Trends

If market is moving:

| Trend | Adjustment |
|-------|------------|
| Rising 5%+ yearly | Can use higher range |
| Stable | Use primary estimate |
| Declining | Use lower range |

### For Unique Properties

Some properties don't have good comparables:

- **Unique architecture**: ±10-20% uncertainty
- **Oversized lot**: Add lot value separately
- **Historic properties**: Specialist market
- **Non-conforming use**: May have premium or discount

## ARV for Different Exit Strategies

### Fix and Flip

Use retail ARV - what a homeowner would pay after full renovation.

**Considerations:**
- Compare to active listings
- Factor in holding costs
- Account for selling costs (6-8%)

### Buy and Hold

Focus on income-based valuation, not just ARV.

**Calculate:**
- Monthly rent potential
- Cap rate analysis
- Price-to-rent ratio

### BRRRR

ARV is critical for refinance planning.

**Key number:**
75% of ARV = Maximum all-in cost to refinance out

### Wholetail

Light rehab to list on MLS.

**Use:**
- ARV with minor adjustment for "as-is" premium market
- Compare to recent investor-friendly sales

## Red Flags in ARV

### Too-High ARV

May indicate:
- Outdated comps (pre-market correction)
- Non-comparable properties used
- Algorithmic error

**Action:** Manually verify top 3 comps

### Too-Low ARV

May indicate:
- Recent distressed sales in data
- Property data errors
- Unusual market conditions

**Action:** Check for foreclosures in comps

### Wide Range

Indicates:
- Unique property
- Limited comparable data
- Rapidly changing market

**Action:** Get multiple opinions

## Using ARV in Deal Analysis

### Quick Screening

```
Quick MAO = ARV × 65% - Estimated Repairs
```

If Quick MAO is significantly below asking price, investigate further.

### Detailed Analysis

```
MAO = (ARV × 70%) - Repairs - Assignment Fee

Buyer's All-In = Your Price + Assignment Fee + Repairs
Buyer's Equity = ARV - Buyer's All-In
```

### Deal Validation

| Metric | Healthy Range |
|--------|---------------|
| Buyer's equity | > 20% of ARV |
| Repairs as % of ARV | < 25% |
| Your MAO as % of ARV | 40-55% |
