# Interpreting Equity Levels

## What Equity Tells You

Equity represents the owner's financial stake in a property. High equity often correlates with motivation to sell and ability to accept discounted offers.

## Calculating Equity

### Basic Equity Formula
```
Equity = Property Value - Outstanding Mortgage

Equity Percentage = (Equity / Property Value) × 100
```

### Example Calculation
```
Estimated Property Value: $300,000
Estimated Mortgage Balance: $120,000
Equity: $300,000 - $120,000 = $180,000
Equity Percentage: $180,000 / $300,000 = 60%
```

### Data Sources for Equity
| Data Point | Source | Accuracy |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Property value | AVM | Moderate |
| Original loan amount | Public records | High |
| Current balance | Estimated from amortization | Moderate |
| Lien amounts | Title search | High |

## Equity Level Categories

### Equity Ranges

| Equity % | Category | Implication |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| 90-100% | Free & Clear | Maximum flexibility |
| 70-89% | Very High | Strong seller position |
| 50-69% | High | Good margin for deals |
| 30-49% | Moderate | Workable with right price |
| 15-29% | Low | Limited room to negotiate |
| 0-14% | Very Low | Little to no flexibility |
| Negative | Underwater | May need short sale |

### Motivation by Equity

| Equity Level | Motivation Signal |
|--------------|------------------|
| Free & Clear | High - no mortgage obligations |
| Very High | High - significant wealth tied up |
| High | Moderate-High - room to negotiate |
| Moderate | Moderate - some flexibility |
| Low | Low - limited room |
| Underwater | Variable - depends on circumstances |

## Reading Equity Data

### Typical Equity Report
```
Property: 123 Main St
Estimated Value: $285,000
Original Loan: $200,000 (2015)
Est. Current Balance: $145,000
Estimated Equity: $140,000
Equity Percentage: 49%

Confidence: Medium (balance estimated from amortization)
```

### Understanding Confidence
| Source | Confidence Level |
|--------|-----------------|
| Recent appraisal + loan payoff | High |
| AVM + amortization estimate | Medium |
| Tax value + original loan | Low |
| AVM only (no loan data) | Very Low |

## Equity Patterns

### High Equity Indicators
- Long ownership duration (10+ years)
- No refinancing history
- Significant appreciation since purchase
- Large down payment originally

### Low Equity Indicators
- Recent purchase (1-3 years)
- Cash-out refinance history
- Market decline since purchase
- High original LTV

### Free and Clear Properties
Likely causes:
- Paid off mortgage
- Inherited property
- Cash purchase
- Very long ownership

## Using Equity in Deal Analysis

### Why High Equity Matters

**For Seller:**
- Can accept lower price and still profit
- No short sale required
- Cleaner, faster closing
- More negotiating room

**For You:**
- More likely to accept your MAO
- Less risk of deal falling through
- Seller has "room" to deal

### Equity-Based MAO Adjustment

Consider seller's equity when structuring offers:

```
High Equity (60%+):
- Seller can accept significant discount
- Your MAO has good chance of acceptance

Moderate Equity (30-50%):
- Seller needs specific minimum
- Calculate their walkaway number

Low Equity (< 30%):
- Limited negotiating room
- May need near-market offer
```

### Calculating Seller's Walkaway

```
Property Value: $250,000
Mortgage Balance: $160,000
Selling Costs (8%): $20,000
Minimum Cash to Seller: $5,000 (assumed)

Minimum Acceptable Price = $160,000 + $20,000 + $5,000 = $185,000
Equity Available for Discount: $250,000 - $185,000 = $65,000 (26%)
```

## Equity + Other Signals

### Stacking Equity with Motivation

**Ideal Stack:**
```
High Equity (50%+) +
Absentee Owner +
Long Ownership +
No Recent Refinance

= Maximum negotiating room + Motivated seller
```

### Equity Without Motivation
```
High Equity but:
- Recent purchase
- Active property management
- Market is appreciating

= May not need to sell, less likely to discount
```

### Low Equity with Distress
```
Low Equity (20%) +
Pre-foreclosure +
Tax delinquent

= Motivated but limited room
Consider: Subject-to, short sale
```

## Special Equity Situations

### Inherited Properties

Often free and clear:
- No mortgage to pay off
- Heirs may want cash fast
- May not know true value
- Excellent opportunity

### Recently Refinanced

Recent cash-out refi suggests:
- Needed money (possible distress)
- Lower equity now
- May have payment strain

### Second Mortgages/HELOCs

Multiple liens reduce equity:
```
Property Value: $300,000
1st Mortgage: $150,000
HELOC: $50,000
True Equity: $100,000 (33%, not 50%)
```

### Underwater Properties

Negative equity options:
- Short sale (lender approval)
- Subject-to (take over payments)
- Wait for appreciation
- Often not viable for wholesale

## Equity Data Limitations

### Estimate Uncertainty

**Mortgage balance estimates:**
- Based on original loan terms
- Doesn't account for extra payments
- Misses refinances you don't know about

**Value estimates:**
- AVM can be wrong
- Property condition unknown
- Market conditions change

### Verify When Possible
```
"Can you tell me approximately what you owe on the property?"
(Direct question in conversation)
```

### Add Margin for Error
```
Estimated Equity: 45%
Confidence: Medium
Working Assumption: 35-45%
Strategy: Price for lower end
```
