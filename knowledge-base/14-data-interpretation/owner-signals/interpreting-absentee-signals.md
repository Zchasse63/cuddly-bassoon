# Interpreting Absentee Owner Signals

## What Absentee Status Tells You

An absentee owner doesn't live at their property. This creates potential motivation because:
- Property is harder to manage from distance
- May lack emotional attachment
- Could be tired of landlord duties
- Might have different priorities

## Identifying Absentee Owners

### Basic Absentee Detection
```
Property Address ≠ Mailing Address → Absentee Owner
```

### Reading Absentee Data
```
Owner: John Smith
Property: 123 Main St, Miami, FL 33139
Mailing: 456 Oak Ave, Miami, FL 33140
Status: ABSENTEE (Local)
Distance: 3.2 miles
```

## Absentee Categories

### By Distance

| Category | Definition | Motivation Level |
|----------|------------|------------------|
| Local Absentee | Same city | Low-Moderate |
| Regional Absentee | Same state, different city | Moderate |
| Out-of-State | Different state | Moderate-High |
| Cross-Country | Opposite coast/distant | High |
| International | Different country | Very High |

### Distance-Based Motivation

| Miles from Property | Typical Motivation | Reasoning |
|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| < 10 miles | Low | Can easily manage |
| 10-50 miles | Low-Moderate | Inconvenient but doable |
| 50-200 miles | Moderate | Real hassle to manage |
| 200-500 miles | Moderate-High | Day trip difficulty |
| 500+ miles | High | Flight required |
| 1000+ miles | Very High | Major travel burden |

## Interpreting Absentee Signals

### Ownership Duration + Distance

| Combo | Interpretation | Opportunity |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| Long ownership + Far away | Inherited or long-time investor | High - may be ready to exit |
| Short ownership + Far away | Recent inheritance or move | Moderate - still deciding |
| Long ownership + Local | Experienced local landlord | Low - knows what they're doing |
| Short ownership + Local | New investor | Low - likely not ready to sell |

### Property Type + Absentee

| Property | Absentee Implication |
|----------|---------------------|
| SFR | Likely rental, may tire of management |
| Multi-family | Investor, assess portfolio fatigue |
| Vacant land | May be forgotten about |
| Vacation home | Seasonal use, maintenance burden |

### Multiple Properties + Absentee

```
Owner has 5+ properties AND is absentee:
- Portfolio manager or investor
- May want to trim portfolio
- OR may be sophisticated, less motivated

Consider:
- Ask about selling multiple
- Higher volume potential
- May have referrals
```

## Absentee Signal Strength

### Strong Absentee Signals
| Signal | Strength | Why |
|--------|----------|-----|
| Out-of-state, 500+ miles | High | Major management burden |
| Different time zone | High | Communication difficulty |
| Property issues visible | Very High | Can't easily address |
| Long ownership + distance | High | Probably tired of managing |

### Weak Absentee Signals
| Signal | Strength | Why |
|--------|----------|-----|
| Local absentee (< 10 miles) | Low | Probably intentional |
| Business address mailing | Low | May be sophisticated investor |
| LLC ownership + local | Low | Business structure choice |

## Absentee + Other Motivation Signals

### Stack Signals for Higher Motivation

**High Motivation Stack:**
```
Absentee (out of state) +
Long ownership (15+ years) +
High equity (50%+) +
No recent permits (deferred maintenance)

= Very High Motivation Score
```

**Moderate Stack:**
```
Absentee (in state, 50+ miles) +
Medium ownership (5-10 years) +
Moderate equity (30-50%)

= Good Opportunity
```

### Watch for Contradicting Signals
```
Absentee BUT:
- Property manager in place
- Recent permits (active management)
- Multiple properties (portfolio investor)
- Short ownership (recent purchase)

= Lower motivation than distance suggests
```

## Using Absentee Data

### Filtering by Absentee
```
"Find properties with:
- Absentee owner
- Owner in different state
- Distance > 100 miles from property"
```

### Messaging Strategy

**Local Absentee:**
"I know managing a rental property takes time and effort..."

**Out-of-State:**
"Managing a property from [their state] must be challenging..."

**Far Distance:**
"I specialize in helping out-of-state owners like yourself who may want a hassle-free sale..."

### Outreach Priority
1. Out-of-state, long ownership, high equity
2. Out-of-state, any ownership duration
3. Regional (50+ miles), long ownership
4. Local absentee with other motivation signals

## Absentee Owner Research

### Learn More About Absentee Owners
```
"Get full profile for absentee owner of [address]:
- All properties owned
- Current residence details
- Ownership duration
- Portfolio size"
```

### Verify Absentee Status
Sometimes data is wrong:
- Owner moved but updated address
- Property manager's address used
- Business address for privacy

**Verify with:**
- Tax bill mailing address
- Multiple data sources
- Direct conversation

## Red Flags in Absentee Data

### May Not Be True Absentee
- PO Box or mailbox service address
- Same city, just different street (may have moved)
- Commercial/business address

### Professional Investors
- Multiple properties with same mailing
- LLC or corporate ownership
- Property management company
- May be less motivated

### Recent Changes
- Just became absentee (job change, family)
- Temporary relocation
- May return to property
