# Interpreting Motivation Scores

## Understanding the Score

Motivation scores predict how likely a property owner is to sell below market value. The score (0-100) combines multiple signals into a single actionable number.

## Score Ranges

| Score | Level | What It Means |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| 80-100 | Very High | Multiple strong distress signals; owner likely needs to sell quickly |
| 60-79 | High | Clear motivation indicators; worth immediate outreach |
| 40-59 | Medium | Some motivation signals; may respond with right approach |
| 20-39 | Low | Weak motivation signals; longer-term prospect |
| 0-19 | Very Low | No apparent motivation; unlikely to discount |

## Score Components

Motivation scores are calculated from these factors:

### Ownership Factors (25%)

| Signal | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| 15+ years ownership (individual) | +20 points |
| Out-of-state owner | +15 points |
| Absentee owner (in-state) | +10 points |
| Recent acquisition (< 2 years) | -15 points |

### Financial Factors (25%)

| Signal | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Tax lien on property | +20 points |
| High equity (60%+) | +15 points |
| Recent refinance (cash-out) | +10 points |
| Low equity (< 20%) | -10 points |

### Property Factors (25%)

| Signal | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Code violations | +20 points |
| Failed listing (expired) | +15 points |
| Abandoned renovation | +15 points |
| Deferred maintenance | +10 points |
| Recent renovation | -15 points |

### Life Event Factors (25%)

| Signal | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Probate/estate | +25 points |
| Pre-foreclosure | +25 points |
| Divorce (if known) | +20 points |
| Bankruptcy | +15 points |

## Interpreting by Owner Type

### Individual Owners

For individuals, motivation often correlates with life changes.

**High motivation patterns:**
- Long ownership + absentee = tired landlord
- Senior owner + deferred maintenance = aging in place issues
- Out-of-state + high equity = inherited or moved away

**Low motivation patterns:**
- Recent purchase = still invested
- Owner-occupied + young = primary home, not selling
- Recent renovation = put money into it

### LLC/Investor Owners

For investors, motivation correlates with business factors.

**High motivation patterns:**
- Short ownership + distress = bad investment exit
- Multiple properties + selling one = portfolio rebalancing
- Abandoned permits = project gone wrong

**Low motivation patterns:**
- Long ownership + cash flow positive = holding
- Active renovation = still investing
- Growing portfolio = accumulating mode

### Institutional Owners

Banks, REOs, and estates have different patterns.

**High motivation patterns:**
- REO property = need to liquidate
- Estate in probate = heirs want cash
- Tax sale property = must dispose

**Low motivation patterns:**
- Active fund = planned exit timeline
- Government owned = specific disposition process

## Using Confidence Levels

Scores include a confidence indicator:

| Confidence | Meaning | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| High | Multiple consistent signals | Trust the score |
| Medium | Some signals, some unknowns | Verify through conversation |
| Low | Limited data available | Gather more info before acting |

## Score Changes Over Time

Motivation can change. Factors that increase motivation:

| Event | Typical Impact |
|-------|----------------|
| Property listed, then expired | +15-20 points |
| Tax becomes delinquent | +15-20 points |
| Owner moves out | +10-15 points |
| Permit abandoned | +10-15 points |
| Time passes (long ownership) | +1-2 points/year |

## Combining Score with Other Data

### Score + Equity

| Combination | Priority | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| High score + high equity | Highest | Best opportunity |
| High score + low equity | Medium | May need creative structure |
| Low score + high equity | Medium | Worth nurturing |
| Low score + low equity | Low | Generally skip |

### Score + Property Condition

| Combination | Strategy |
|-------------|----------|
| High score + good condition | Quick flip to retail buyer |
| High score + needs work | Traditional wholesale to flipper |
| Low score + good condition | Nurture for future opportunity |
| Low score + needs work | Generally skip unless deep discount |
