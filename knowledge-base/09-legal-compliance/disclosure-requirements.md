# Disclosure Requirements for Real Estate Wholesalers - Complete Compliance Guide

## Quick Reference

- **Always disclose your role**: Tell sellers you're an investor who may assign the contract, not the end buyer
- **Assignment fees**: Many states require disclosure of your assignment fee amount or spread to both parties
- **Material facts**: You must disclose any known defects, liens, title issues, or conditions affecting property value
- **Written documentation**: All critical disclosures should be in writing with signed acknowledgments
- **Timing matters**: Disclose your position and intentions before the seller signs any contract
- **You are NOT an agent**: Never represent yourself as acting on behalf of either party unless properly licensed
- **State laws vary dramatically**: Some states require specific disclosure forms, others have minimal requirements
- **Consequences are severe**: Non-disclosure can result in voided contracts, lawsuits, fines, or criminal charges
- **Transparency builds reputation**: Full disclosure protects you legally AND creates repeat business opportunities
- **Document everything**: Keep records of all disclosures for a minimum of 7 years

## Understanding Disclosure Requirements in Wholesaling

Disclosure requirements exist to protect all parties in a real estate transaction from fraud, misrepresentation, and hidden information that could affect their decision-making. As a wholesaler, you occupy a unique position that requires careful attention to what you communicate—and what you're legally obligated to reveal.

Unlike licensed real estate agents who have clearly defined fiduciary duties, wholesalers operate in a gray area that varies significantly by jurisdiction. This makes understanding disclosure requirements even more critical. Getting this wrong doesn't just cost you deals—it can cost you your entire business, your personal assets, and potentially your freedom.

### Why Disclosure Matters Beyond Legal Compliance

Beyond avoiding lawsuits and regulatory action, proper disclosure creates sustainable business advantages. Sellers who feel they were treated honestly become referral sources. End buyers who trust your deals close faster and pay more. Title companies and attorneys prefer working with transparent wholesalers. Your reputation becomes your competitive moat.

## What Must Be Disclosed to Sellers

When working with motivated sellers, you have specific disclosure obligations that begin before any contract is signed.

### Your Position and Intentions

You must clearly communicate:

1. **You are purchasing the property as an investor**, not as an owner-occupant
2. **You may assign or sell your interest** in the contract to another buyer
3. **You are not a licensed real estate agent** acting on their behalf (unless you actually hold a license)
4. **You intend to profit from this transaction**
5. **You will not be providing them with market analysis** or advice about whether they should sell

### The Equitable Interest Explanation

Explain that when they sign the purchase agreement, you're acquiring "equitable interest" in the property. This means you have a legal right to purchase the property, but you may transfer that right to another investor. Be specific: "I'm buying the right to purchase your property, and I may sell that right to another investor who will actually close on the purchase."

### Assignment Possibility

Your contract should include assignability language, and you should verbally explain this clause. A proper disclosure sounds like:

"Mr. Johnson, I want to make sure you understand—I may not be the person who shows up at closing. I work with a network of investors, and I might assign this contract to one of them. They'll close on the same terms we've agreed to, and you'll receive your $85,000 regardless of who the final buyer is. Does that make sense?"

### Price Differential Disclosure

Many states now require you to disclose that you may sell the property or contract for more than your purchase price. While you don't always need to disclose the exact amount of your profit, sellers should understand you're making money on the spread.

## What Must Be Disclosed to End Buyers

Your disclosure obligations to cash buyers and investor clients are equally important.

### Property Condition

You must disclose any property defects or issues you're aware of, including:

- Structural problems (foundation cracks, roof damage, settling)
- Water damage or mold history
- Electrical or plumbing issues
- Environmental hazards (lead paint, asbestos, underground storage tanks)
- Pest infestations (termites, rodents)
- Zoning violations or unpermitted work
- Neighborhood issues (flood zones, crime patterns, planned developments)

### Title and Ownership Issues

Disclose any known:

- Liens on the property (tax liens, mechanic's liens, judgment liens)
- Easements or encroachments
- Boundary disputes
- HOA violations or unpaid dues
- Pending litigation involving the property

### Your Profit and Contract Terms

End buyers should know:

- Your assignment fee amount (required in many states)
- The original contract price with the seller
- Any terms or contingencies that transfer with the assignment
- Timeline requirements and closing deadlines

## Assignment Fee Disclosure: Timing and Method

Assignment fee disclosure is one of the most debated topics in wholesaling. Here's how to handle it properly.

### When to Disclose

**Best Practice**: Disclose your assignment fee before the end buyer commits to the purchase. This means:

- When presenting the deal opportunity
- In your marketing materials (stating "assignment fee applies")
- Before any earnest money deposits
- During initial deal discussions

**Minimum Requirement**: At contract signing at the latest. Never surprise a buyer at closing.

### How to Disclose

**Written disclosure** is always preferred. Include language like:

"Buyer acknowledges that Assignor acquired the original Purchase Agreement at a price of $85,000 and is assigning said contract for a total of $100,000, resulting in an assignment fee of $15,000 to Assignor."

**Verbal disclosure** should accompany written disclosure:

"Just so we're clear, I have this property under contract for $85,000, and I'm assigning it to you for $100,000. My assignment fee is $15,000. The numbers work because you're looking at a $165,000 ARV with about $30,000 in repairs."

### Double Close Alternative

If you prefer not to disclose your exact profit, consider double closing instead of assigning. In a double close, two separate transactions occur—you buy from the seller, then immediately sell to your buyer. Your profit becomes a private matter between two independent transactions.

## Material Facts That Must Be Disclosed

Material facts are pieces of information that would affect a reasonable person's decision to purchase. You have a legal duty to disclose material facts you know about.

### Categories of Material Facts

**Physical Condition**
- Any defects that affect habitability or safety
- Age and condition of major systems (HVAC, roof, plumbing, electrical)
- Recent repairs or renovations (especially if unpermitted)

**Legal Status**
- Pending foreclosure or bankruptcy proceedings
- Property tax delinquency
- Code enforcement actions
- Title defects or clouds

**Environmental Issues**
- Flood zone status
- Soil contamination
- Lead paint (required federal disclosure for pre-1978 homes)
- Proximity to environmental hazards

**Economic Factors**
- Rental history and tenant issues (if applicable)
- Special assessments
- Upcoming property tax reassessments
- HOA financial problems

### The "Knowledge" Standard

You're required to disclose what you actually know. However, willful ignorance doesn't protect you. If you deliberately avoid learning about obvious problems, courts may treat this as constructive knowledge.

**Example**: You notice water stains on a ceiling but don't ask about them because you "don't want to know." This doesn't protect you—you observed evidence of water damage and should disclose it.

## Known Defects Disclosure Obligations

Your duty to disclose known defects is non-negotiable and applies even in "as-is" sales.

### The "As-Is" Myth

Many wholesalers believe that selling "as-is" eliminates disclosure requirements. This is false. "As-is" means the seller won't make repairs—it doesn't eliminate your duty to disclose defects you know about.

### What Constitutes "Known"

A defect is "known" if:

- You observed it during property visits
- The seller told you about it
- It was revealed in any inspection or report you received
- It's obvious from documents you reviewed (survey, title report, etc.)

### Disclosure Documentation

Create a written defect disclosure that includes:

- Date of disclosure
- Specific defect description
- How you learned of the defect
- Buyer's acknowledgment signature

**Example Disclosure Language**:

"Seller has advised Assignor, and Assignor hereby advises Buyer, that the property has experienced basement water intrusion during heavy rainstorms. Seller installed a sump pump in 2019 to address this issue. Buyer acknowledges receiving this disclosure and accepts the property with knowledge of this condition."

## Your Role as Wholesaler: Not Agent, Not Principal

Clearly defining your role protects you from unlicensed activity allegations and sets proper expectations.

### What You Are

- A **contract purchaser** exercising your right to assign
- An **investor** seeking to profit from real estate transactions
- A **principal** in the transaction (you're acting for yourself, not others)

### What You Are NOT

- A **real estate agent** representing the seller's interests
- A **broker** facilitating between parties for commission
- A **fiduciary** with duties of loyalty to either party

### The Disclosure Script

Use this language with sellers:

"I want to be very clear about my role here. I'm not a real estate agent, and I'm not working for you or representing your interests. I'm an investor looking to buy properties at a discount so I can profit. I may assign this contract to another investor who will close on the purchase. You should consult with your own attorney or advisor if you have questions about whether this is a good decision for you."

## Dual Agency Concerns and Avoidance

Dual agency occurs when one party represents both the buyer and seller. As an unlicensed wholesaler, you cannot legally represent either party.

### The Trap

Problems arise when you:

- Tell sellers you're "helping them sell their property"
- Tell buyers you're "finding properties for them"
- Provide advice about pricing, terms, or negotiation strategy
- Collect fees from both parties for representation

### Avoidance Strategies

**With Sellers**: You're buying, not helping them sell. You're acting in your own interest.

**With Buyers**: You're selling your contract rights, not representing them. They should do their own due diligence.

**Never**:
- Give advice about whether someone should accept a price
- Suggest you're protecting anyone's interests but your own
- Create the impression of a fiduciary relationship

## Written vs. Verbal Disclosures

Both have their place, but written disclosures provide protection that verbal ones cannot.

### When Written Disclosure Is Required

- Assignment fee disclosure (in most states)
- Lead paint disclosure (federal law for pre-1978 homes)
- Material defect acknowledgment
- Role and intention disclosure
- Any state-mandated disclosure forms

### Best Practice: Both

Make verbal disclosures AND follow up in writing. Your verbal explanation ensures understanding; your written documentation proves the disclosure occurred.

### Documentation System

Create a disclosure checklist that you complete for every transaction:

| Disclosure Item | Verbal Date | Written Date | Acknowledged |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Investor status | 1/15/25 | 1/15/25 | ✓ |
| Assignment possibility | 1/15/25 | 1/15/25 | ✓ |
| Known defects | 1/15/25 | 1/17/25 | ✓ |
| Assignment fee (to buyer) | 1/20/25 | 1/20/25 | ✓ |

## Disclosure Forms and Templates

Using standardized forms ensures consistency and completeness.

### Essential Disclosure Documents

**Wholesaler Position Disclosure (for sellers)**
Explains your role, assignment rights, and profit motive. Signed before purchase agreement.

**Assignment Fee Disclosure (for buyers)**
States original contract price, assignment price, and your fee. Signed before or with assignment agreement.

**Property Condition Disclosure (for buyers)**
Lists all known defects and issues. Include even if state doesn't require it.

**Lead Paint Disclosure (federal)**
Required for all pre-1978 residential properties. Non-negotiable federal requirement.

### Template Language

**Investor Disclosure to Seller**:

"The undersigned Seller acknowledges that Buyer ([Your Company]) is a real estate investor purchasing this property for investment purposes. Seller understands that Buyer may assign this contract to another investor and may profit from this transaction. Buyer is not a licensed real estate agent and is not representing Seller's interests. Seller has been advised to seek independent legal and financial counsel before executing this agreement."

## Consequences of Non-Disclosure

The risks of inadequate disclosure range from deal collapse to criminal prosecution.

### Civil Consequences

- **Contract rescission**: The entire deal can be voided
- **Damages**: You may owe actual damages plus consequential damages
- **Fraud claims**: Intentional non-disclosure can trigger fraud liability
- **Attorney fees**: Many states require the losing party to pay legal costs

### Regulatory Consequences

- **Unlicensed activity charges**: Failing to disclose your role properly
- **Fines**: State real estate commissions can impose significant penalties
- **Cease and desist orders**: You may be prohibited from wholesaling

### Criminal Consequences

In extreme cases involving intentional fraud:

- Wire fraud charges
- Real estate fraud prosecution
- Theft by deception charges

### Real-World Example

A wholesaler in Texas failed to disclose foundation issues they knew about. The end buyer purchased the property, discovered $45,000 in foundation repairs was needed, and sued. The court awarded $45,000 in damages, $12,000 in attorney fees, and $15,000 in punitive damages. The wholesaler's $8,000 assignment fee turned into a $64,000 loss.

## State-Specific Disclosure Requirements

Disclosure requirements vary dramatically by state. Here are notable variations:

### Illinois
Requires wholesale transactions to disclose assignment fees and prohibits wholesalers from advertising properties they don't own.

### Oklahoma
The "Oklahoma Wholesaling Real Estate Act" requires specific disclosures and limits the number of transactions without a license.

### Ohio
Requires disclosure that the wholesaler may not be the actual buyer and that the contract may be assigned.

### Texas
TREC has issued guidance that certain wholesaling activities may constitute brokerage requiring licensure.

### California
Requires disclosure of any known material facts affecting property value and has strict fraud statutes.

### Action Item
Research your specific state's requirements. Contact your state real estate commission or consult with a local real estate attorney before beginning any wholesaling activities.

## Best Practices for Transparency

Going beyond minimum requirements builds a sustainable business.

### The Transparency Advantage

**Build Trust**: Sellers who feel informed become referral sources
**Close Faster**: Buyers who understand the deal have fewer surprises
**Avoid Disputes**: Clear communication prevents misunderstandings
**Professional Reputation**: Title companies and attorneys prefer working with transparent wholesalers

### Implementation Checklist

1. Create standard disclosure documents for every transaction
2. Explain your role verbally before presenting contracts
3. Put all material disclosures in writing
4. Get signed acknowledgments from all parties
5. Maintain disclosure records for at least 7 years
6. When in doubt, disclose
7. Consult with an attorney on state-specific requirements
8. Update your disclosures when laws change

## Examples

### Example 1: Proper Seller Disclosure

Sarah finds a motivated seller, Mr. Williams, who wants to sell his inherited property for $95,000. Before presenting her purchase agreement, Sarah says:

"Mr. Williams, I want to explain exactly how this works. I'm a real estate investor, not a real estate agent. I'm buying your property because I think I can make a profit—either by fixing it up or by selling my contract to another investor who will do the rehab. You should know that I may not be the one who closes on this purchase. I might assign the contract to another investor, and they would complete the purchase on the same terms we agree to. You'd still get your $95,000 either way. I'm telling you this because I want you to understand my role and make an informed decision. Do you have any questions?"

Mr. Williams signs an investor disclosure acknowledgment before signing the purchase agreement.

### Example 2: Proper Buyer Disclosure

Sarah assigns the contract to her buyer, Marcus, for $110,000. Her disclosure includes:

Written disclosure: "Assignor acquired the Purchase Agreement for $95,000. Assignment price to Assignee is $110,000. Assignment fee payable to Assignor at closing: $15,000. Assignor has disclosed the following property conditions: (1) HVAC system is 18 years old and may need replacement, (2) Roof was replaced in 2015 per seller, (3) Property is sold AS-IS with no warranties."

Verbal explanation: "Marcus, I've got this under contract at $95,000, and I'm assigning it to you at $110,000, so my assignment fee is $15,000. The seller mentioned the HVAC is original and the roof was done about 10 years ago. I'd recommend getting your own inspections."

### Example 3: Double Close for Privacy

James prefers not to disclose his assignment fee. He's purchasing a property for $120,000 and has an end buyer at $148,000.

Instead of assigning, James arranges a double close:

- **Transaction 1**: James purchases from seller at $120,000
- **Transaction 2**: James sells to end buyer at $148,000 (30 minutes later)

James discloses his role to the seller properly and discloses the property condition to the buyer. He doesn't disclose his $28,000 profit because these are two separate, independent transactions.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Failing to disclose your investor status to sellers**: They should know you're buying to profit, not to live there. This creates unrealistic expectations and potential fraud claims.

2. **Hiding your assignment fee**: Many states require this disclosure. Even where not required, hidden fees lead to closing table disputes.

3. **Relying on verbal-only disclosures**: You can't prove what you said. Always follow up in writing with acknowledgment signatures.

4. **Using "we" language that implies representation**: Saying "we can get you a great price" implies agency. Say "I'm offering to buy at..."

5. **Failing to disclose known defects**: "As-is" doesn't protect you. If you know about it, disclose it.

6. **Not getting signed acknowledgments**: An unsigned disclosure has minimal legal value. Always get signatures.

7. **Waiting until closing to disclose assignment fees**: This creates disputes and collapsed closings. Disclose before buyers commit.

8. **Ignoring state-specific requirements**: Generic disclosure forms may not meet your state's standards. Customize for your jurisdiction.

9. **Providing market analysis or pricing advice**: This crosses into brokerage activity. Let parties do their own research.

10. **Failing to document disclosure timing**: Keep records showing when you disclosed what to whom. Dates matter in legal disputes.
