# TCPA and Marketing Compliance for Real Estate Wholesalers

## Quick Reference

- **TCPA violations cost $500-$1,500 PER CALL or TEXT** — a single campaign mistake can result in six or seven-figure liability
- **Prior express written consent** is required before using autodialers or prerecorded messages to cell phones
- You must scrub your calling lists against the **National Do Not Call Registry** every 31 days
- **Time restrictions**: Only call between 8:00 AM and 9:00 PM in the recipient's local time zone
- Text messages (SMS) are treated as calls under TCPA — all the same rules apply
- **Maintain records for 5 years**: consent documentation, call logs, opt-out requests, and DNC scrub dates
- **CAN-SPAM requires**: physical address, opt-out mechanism, and accurate subject lines in commercial emails
- **Manual dialing with human conversation** has fewer restrictions than autodialers or prerecorded messages
- Some states have stricter rules than federal law — California, Florida, and Oklahoma require additional compliance
- Class action lawsuits are common — one plaintiff can represent thousands of contacted consumers

## Understanding the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA)

The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 is the primary federal law governing telemarketing, and it's the single biggest legal threat to real estate wholesalers who use phone-based marketing. The FCC enforces TCPA regulations, and private citizens can sue directly for violations — which is exactly why this law generates billions of dollars in lawsuits annually.

As a wholesaler, you're making marketing calls to property owners. Whether you call it "prospecting," "lead generation," or "motivated seller outreach," the law calls it telemarketing, and you must comply.

### Why TCPA Matters for Wholesalers

Real estate wholesalers are particularly vulnerable to TCPA lawsuits for several reasons:

1. **High call volume**: You might contact hundreds or thousands of property owners monthly
2. **Cold outreach**: You're calling people who haven't requested contact
3. **Technology use**: Many wholesalers use autodialers, power dialers, or mass texting platforms
4. **Documented violations**: Every call or text creates a record that plaintiffs' attorneys love

A single campaign to 1,000 phone numbers using non-compliant methods could expose you to **$500,000 to $1,500,000 in liability**. This isn't theoretical — wholesalers have faced class action lawsuits resulting in settlements exceeding $1 million.

## Prior Express Written Consent Requirements

The level of consent required depends on the technology you use and the type of phone you're calling.

### Consent Tiers Explained

**Tier 1: No Special Consent Required**
- Manual dialing (physically pressing each digit)
- Live human conversation
- Calling landlines (with some exceptions)
- Residential numbers not on DNC lists

**Tier 2: Prior Express Consent Required**
- Calls to cell phones using autodialers (live human answers)
- Must have consent, but it doesn't need to be written

**Tier 3: Prior Express Written Consent Required**
- Autodialed calls with prerecorded messages to cell phones
- All prerecorded telemarketing messages (regardless of how dialed)
- Text messages sent via autodialer to cell phones

### What Qualifies as Prior Express Written Consent

Your consent must include these elements:

1. **Written agreement** (paper or electronic signature)
2. **Clear authorization** to receive telemarketing calls/texts
3. **Specific phone number** the consumer authorizes you to contact
4. **Disclosure** that consent isn't required to purchase anything
5. **Name of your company** being authorized to call

**Example Consent Language:**

```
By providing my phone number and signing below, I authorize [Your Company Name]
to contact me regarding real estate offers and services using automated dialing
systems, prerecorded messages, and/or text messages at the phone number provided,
even if this number is on a Do Not Call list. I understand that consent is not
a condition of any purchase. Message and data rates may apply. I may revoke
this consent at any time.

Phone Number: _______________
Signature: _______________
Date: _______________
```

### Consent for Wholesaling Scenarios

**Inbound Leads (Website, Bandit Signs, Direct Mail Responses):**
When a seller calls you or fills out your website form, they're initiating contact. This establishes an "inquiry-based" relationship, but it does NOT automatically grant consent for autodialed calls or texts. Your web form should include explicit consent language.

**Skip-Traced Lists:**
Having someone's phone number from skip tracing provides ZERO consent. You must either:
- Call manually with live conversation, OR
- Obtain written consent before using autodialers/prerecorded messages

**Purchased Lead Lists:**
Consent doesn't transfer with purchased leads unless the original consent specifically named your company. "Blanket consent" to receive calls from "partners" is legally questionable and frequently challenged.

## Do Not Call (DNC) List Compliance

### National DNC Registry Requirements

The FTC maintains the National Do Not Call Registry, and you must comply:

1. **Register your company** at telemarketing.donotcall.gov (annual fee: $74 for up to 5 area codes, scaled pricing for more)
2. **Download numbers** for your calling areas
3. **Scrub your lists** against the registry before calling
4. **Re-scrub every 31 days** — the registry updates constantly
5. **Honor registrations immediately** — numbers added to DNC must be suppressed

### Internal DNC List Requirements

Beyond the national registry, you must maintain your own "internal" or "company-specific" DNC list:

- **Anyone who says "don't call me"** must be added immediately
- **Honor requests within 30 days** (best practice: immediately)
- **Keep the list indefinitely** — there's no expiration
- **Apply it to all your marketing** — the request covers your entire company

### EBR Exception (Established Business Relationship)

You may call DNC-registered numbers if you have an "established business relationship":

- **Transaction EBR**: Lasts 18 months from last transaction
- **Inquiry EBR**: Lasts 3 months from inquiry date
- **EBR ends immediately** if the consumer asks you to stop calling

**Critical Note for Wholesalers**: Looking at someone's property records or skip tracing their phone number does NOT create an EBR. The relationship must be initiated by the consumer.

## Opt-Out Requirements and Procedures

### During Calls

When someone asks you to stop calling, you must:

1. **Stop immediately** — don't try to "overcome the objection"
2. **Confirm you're removing them** — "I'll remove your number from our list right away"
3. **Document the request** — date, time, phone number, who received the request
4. **Process within 30 days** (FTC requirement), though best practice is immediate
5. **Apply company-wide** — all VAs, team members, and campaigns must honor it

### For Text Messages

Every marketing text must include clear opt-out instructions:

**Example**: "Reply STOP to unsubscribe"

When someone replies STOP (or similar: QUIT, CANCEL, UNSUBSCRIBE, END):
- Send ONE confirmation message: "You've been unsubscribed and will receive no further messages"
- Stop all future texts immediately
- Document the opt-out request

### For Prerecorded Messages

Prerecorded calls must include:
- An automated opt-out mechanism (press 2 to be removed)
- A toll-free callback number for opt-out
- Must process opt-out requests immediately

## Text Message (SMS) Marketing Rules

Text messages are treated as "calls" under TCPA, with additional considerations:

### SMS-Specific Requirements

1. **All TCPA rules apply** — consent, DNC scrubbing, opt-out
2. **Prior express written consent required** for marketing texts sent via autodialer (which includes virtually all mass-texting platforms)
3. **Include opt-out instructions** in every message
4. **Identify yourself** — recipients must know who's texting
5. **CTIA guidelines** (carrier requirements) add additional layers

### Carrier Filtering and 10DLC Registration

Beyond legal compliance, carriers (Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile) actively filter "spam" messages:

- **Register for 10DLC** (10-digit long code) through your SMS provider
- **Complete carrier vetting** for your use case
- **Maintain good "trust scores"** — high opt-out rates or spam reports will get you blocked
- **Throughput limits** apply based on your registration tier

### SMS Best Practices for Wholesalers

**Compliant First Message Example:**
```
Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] with [Company]. I'm reaching out about
your property at [Address]. Would you consider an offer? Reply STOP
to opt out.
```

**What NOT to Send:**
- Messages without identification
- Messages without opt-out instructions
- Messages to numbers without proper consent
- High-volume blasts from unregistered numbers

## Autodialer and Prerecorded Message Restrictions

### What Qualifies as an Autodialer (ATDS)?

The definition of "automatic telephone dialing system" (ATDS) has been narrowed by recent court decisions (Facebook v. Duguid, 2021), but you should know:

**Likely ATDS:**
- Systems that generate random or sequential numbers to dial
- Predictive dialers that call multiple numbers simultaneously
- Mass-texting platforms that send to lists automatically

**Likely NOT ATDS:**
- Power dialers that dial one number at a time from a preset list
- Click-to-dial systems
- Manual dialing

**Important**: Courts vary in their interpretation. The safest approach is to assume platforms that automatically send to lists qualify as ATDS unless you have legal counsel confirming otherwise.

### Prerecorded Message Rules

Prerecorded/artificial voice calls to cell phones require prior express written consent regardless of how the call is dialed. These calls must also:

- Identify the caller at the beginning of the message
- Include the caller's phone number
- Provide an opt-out mechanism

**Ringless Voicemail (RVM)**: Delivers prerecorded messages directly to voicemail. The FCC treats these as "calls" subject to TCPA. Prior express written consent is required for marketing RVM to cell phones.

## Time-of-Day Calling Restrictions

### Federal Time Restrictions

**Legal calling hours: 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM** in the consumer's local time zone.

This seems simple, but consider:
- If you're in California calling Florida, Florida is 3 hours ahead
- A 6:00 AM call in your time zone is 9:00 AM in their time zone (legal)
- A 7:00 PM call in your time zone is 10:00 PM in their time zone (illegal)

### Best Practice Calling Windows

**Optimal compliant windows:**
- 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM local time (safe buffer)
- Account for time zone differences in your dialer settings
- Segment lists by time zone for efficient calling

### State-Specific Time Restrictions

Some states have tighter windows:
- **Oklahoma**: 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM
- **Some states**: No calls on Sundays or holidays

## Record-Keeping Requirements

Proper documentation is your defense against TCPA lawsuits. Maintain these records for **at least 5 years**:

### Required Documentation

| Record Type | What to Keep | Retention Period |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| Consent Records | Signed consent forms, website form submissions with timestamps | 5+ years |
| Call Logs | Date, time, number called, duration, outcome | 5 years |
| DNC Scrub Dates | Proof you scrubbed before each campaign | 5 years |
| Opt-Out Requests | Date received, phone number, how processed | Indefinitely |
| Internal DNC List | Current list with dates added | Ongoing |
| Policy Documents | Your TCPA compliance policies and training | Indefinitely |

### Practical Record-Keeping Systems

1. **CRM with compliance features**: Track consent source, date, and opt-outs
2. **Call recording**: Many dialers offer this — great for proving consent
3. **Screenshot website forms**: Document exactly what consent language visitors see
4. **DNC scrub certificates**: Most scrubbing services provide these
5. **Automated logging**: Use platforms that automatically timestamp everything

## TCPA Violation Penalties

### Penalty Structure

| Violation Type | Penalty Per Violation |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Standard violation | $500 per call/text |
| Willful or knowing violation | $1,500 per call/text |

### Calculating Your Exposure

**Example Scenario:**
You send a mass text campaign to 5,000 numbers using an autodialer without proper written consent.

- **Best case (standard)**: 5,000 × $500 = **$2,500,000**
- **Worst case (willful)**: 5,000 × $1,500 = **$7,500,000**

Even a "small" campaign of 200 texts = $100,000 to $300,000 exposure.

### How Lawsuits Happen

1. **Individual lawsuits**: One person sues for their violations ($500-$1,500)
2. **Class action lawsuits**: One plaintiff represents all affected consumers (massive exposure)
3. **FCC enforcement**: Government action with additional penalties
4. **State attorney general**: State-level enforcement actions

**Class action economics**: Plaintiffs' attorneys actively look for TCPA cases because statutory damages are automatic — they don't need to prove actual harm. Your call/text records become evidence against you.

## CAN-SPAM Act for Email Marketing

While phone marketing gets more attention, email marketing has its own rules under the CAN-SPAM Act.

### CAN-SPAM Requirements

1. **No false header information**: Your "From" name and email must be accurate
2. **No deceptive subject lines**: Must reflect message content
3. **Identify as advertisement**: Clearly disclose if it's a commercial message
4. **Include physical address**: Your valid postal address must appear
5. **Explain how to opt out**: Clear, conspicuous instructions
6. **Honor opt-outs within 10 days**: Process unsubscribes promptly
7. **Monitor third parties**: You're responsible if others send on your behalf

### CAN-SPAM Penalties

- **Up to $50,120 per email** in violation
- Both the company sending and the company whose product is promoted can be liable

### Email Best Practices for Wholesalers

**Footer Example:**
```
[Your Company Name]
[Street Address]
[City, State ZIP]

You received this email because [reason].
To unsubscribe, click here: [unsubscribe link]
```

## State-Specific Telemarketing Laws

Federal law sets the floor, but many states add stricter requirements.

### Notable State Variations

**California:**
- Requires state DNC registration (separate from national)
- Call recording requires two-party consent (both parties must know)
- Additional restrictions on automated calls

**Florida:**
- State telemarketing license required for certain activities
- Three-day "cooling off" period for some contracts
- Stricter consent requirements

**Oklahoma:**
- Call window: 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM (one hour shorter than federal)
- Additional registration requirements

**New York:**
- Telemarketer registration required
- Additional disclosure requirements

**Pennsylvania:**
- Two-party consent for call recording
- State-specific DNC rules

### Compliance Strategy for Multi-State Calling

1. **Know your target states**: If you wholesale in specific markets, learn those state laws
2. **Apply the strictest standard**: When in doubt, follow the most restrictive rule
3. **Segment by state**: Some dialers allow state-specific calling rules
4. **Consult local counsel**: For states where you do heavy volume

## Examples

### Example 1: Compliant Cold Calling Campaign

**Scenario**: You want to call 500 absentee owners in a target zip code.

**Compliant Approach:**
1. Skip trace the list to obtain phone numbers ($75 at $0.15/record)
2. Scrub against National DNC ($2.50 at $0.005/number) — 47 numbers removed
3. Scrub against your internal DNC — 3 numbers removed
4. Scrub against litigator database ($2.25) — 8 numbers removed
5. Remaining callable numbers: 442
6. Use manual dial or click-to-dial system (NOT autodialer)
7. Assign to VA calling between 10 AM - 7 PM recipient's time
8. VA speaks live with each person (no prerecorded messages)
9. Any "don't call" requests added to internal DNC immediately
10. All calls logged in CRM

**Result**: Compliant campaign with minimal TCPA exposure.

### Example 2: Non-Compliant Text Campaign Gone Wrong

**Scenario**: Wholesaler sends mass text blast to 3,000 skip-traced numbers.

**What Went Wrong:**
- Used autodialing SMS platform
- No prior express written consent
- Didn't include opt-out instructions
- Didn't scrub against DNC
- Sent at 9:30 PM (too late in recipient's time zone)

**Outcome:**
- 47 recipients complained to the FCC
- 3 filed individual lawsuits
- 1 attorney filed class action on behalf of all 3,000 recipients
- Settlement: $1.2 million plus $180,000 in attorney fees
- Business closed, personal bankruptcy filed

### Example 3: Building a Compliant SMS Follow-Up System

**Scenario**: You want to text leads who submitted forms on your website.

**Compliant Setup:**
1. Website form includes TCPA-compliant consent language
2. Checkbox: "I agree to receive text messages from [Company]"
3. Form stores: name, phone, consent timestamp, IP address, form version
4. New leads automatically tagged "SMS-consent-granted" in CRM
5. Only SMS-consented leads receive text follow-up
6. Every text includes company name and "Reply STOP to opt out"
7. STOP replies automatically processed and logged
8. Records retained for 5+ years

**Result**: Defensible SMS marketing program with documented consent.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Assuming Skip-Traced Numbers Have Consent
**Why it's dangerous**: Having someone's phone number is not permission to use autodialers or prerecorded messages on cell phones.
**Fix**: Use manual dialing for cold outreach, or obtain written consent first.

### 2. Not Scrubbing Lists Frequently Enough
**Why it's dangerous**: Numbers get added to DNC constantly. Old scrub = new liability.
**Fix**: Re-scrub every campaign, or at minimum every 31 days.

### 3. Ignoring Time Zone Differences
**Why it's dangerous**: A legal call in your time zone may be illegal in theirs.
**Fix**: Use dialers with time zone detection, or segment lists by geography.

### 4. Using "STOP" as the Only Opt-Out Word
**Why it's dangerous**: Consumers might reply "remove me" or "take me off your list."
**Fix**: Honor any reasonable opt-out request, train VAs to recognize variations.

### 5. Not Documenting Consent Properly
**Why it's dangerous**: In a lawsuit, the burden is on YOU to prove consent existed.
**Fix**: Timestamp everything, store consent records, screenshot web forms.

### 6. Treating Landlines and Cell Phones Identically
**Why it's dangerous**: Cell phones have stricter protections than landlines.
**Fix**: Know which numbers are cell phones (most skip trace data includes line type).

### 7. Relying on Purchased "Consent"
**Why it's dangerous**: Consent typically doesn't transfer to third parties.
**Fix**: Obtain your own consent or use compliant cold-calling methods.

### 8. Sending Ringless Voicemail Without Consent
**Why it's dangerous**: RVM is treated as a "call" requiring the same consent as calls.
**Fix**: Only send RVM to properly consented numbers.

### 9. Not Maintaining an Internal DNC List
**Why it's dangerous**: Previous opt-out requests must be honored forever.
**Fix**: Centralized DNC list applied to all campaigns and team members.

### 10. Delegating Compliance to VAs Without Training
**Why it's dangerous**: You're liable for your team's violations.
**Fix**: Train all callers on TCPA, document training, monitor compliance.
