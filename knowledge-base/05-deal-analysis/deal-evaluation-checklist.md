# The Complete Deal Evaluation Checklist: A 3-Phase System for Analyzing Wholesale Deals

## Quick Reference

- **Never skip Phase 1**: The 2-minute quick screen saves hours of wasted effort on dead-end leads
- **Minimum equity threshold**: Properties should have at least 30-40% equity before proceeding to Phase 2
- **The 70% Rule baseline**: MAO = (ARV × 70%) - Repairs - Your Assignment Fee
- **Always verify ARV with 3-6 comparable sales** from the last 90 days within 0.5 miles
- **Motivation trumps equity**: A motivated seller with 35% equity beats an unmotivated seller with 60% equity
- **Score every deal 1-100** using the rubric before making an offer—deals below 60 rarely close
- **Tiered offers increase acceptance rates by 40%** compared to single-price offers
- **Title issues kill 15-20% of wholesale deals**—always run preliminary title searches before deep negotiations
- **Document everything**: Your offer package should include contract, proof of funds, and credibility kit
- **Know your exit before you enter**: Identify at least two viable exit strategies for every deal

## Phase 1: Quick Screen (2 Minutes)

The quick screen exists for one purpose: eliminate non-deals fast. You should spend no more than two minutes on this phase. If a property fails any of these five checks, move on immediately.

### Equity Check

Equity is the foundation of every wholesale deal. Without sufficient equity, there's no room for you, the seller, and your buyer to all get paid.

**How to check equity quickly:**
1. Look up the property on your county assessor's website
2. Note the estimated market value (understand this is often 6-12 months outdated)
3. Cross-reference with Zillow, Redfin, or PropStream for a quick value estimate
4. Check for recorded mortgages in public records or use a data service

**Minimum equity thresholds:**
- **Green light**: 40%+ equity — proceed to ownership check
- **Yellow light**: 30-40% equity — proceed cautiously, requires highly motivated seller
- **Red light**: Below 30% equity — typically not viable unless creative financing applies

**Quick equity formula:**
Estimated Equity % = (Estimated Value - Known Liens) ÷ Estimated Value × 100

### Ownership Duration

How long someone has owned a property reveals both equity potential and motivation patterns.

**Ownership duration benchmarks:**
- **Less than 1 year**: Likely little equity, possible flip gone wrong, or distressed purchase
- **1-5 years**: Moderate equity, may have refinanced, check for second mortgages
- **5-15 years**: Good equity accumulation, often inherited or life-change situations
- **15+ years**: Typically substantial equity, often owned free and clear

Properties owned less than 12 months require extra scrutiny. Ask about the purchase circumstances and verify there's no chain of title issues.

### Owner Type Identification

Different owner types respond to different approaches and have different deal potential.

**Primary owner types to identify:**
- **Owner-occupied individual**: Lives in property, may need relocation timeline
- **Absentee owner**: Doesn't live there, often more motivated, easier negotiations
- **Out-of-state owner**: High motivation category, managing from distance creates pain
- **Corporate/LLC ownership**: May be investor-owned, could be institutional, verify decision-maker
- **Estate/Trust ownership**: Often highly motivated, may require multiple signatures
- **Bank/REO**: Different process entirely, typically not wholesale-friendly

**Quick identification method**: Check the mailing address versus property address. If different, you have an absentee owner—a prime wholesale candidate.

### Property Type Match

Not every property fits your buyer pool. Evaluate against your active buyer criteria.

**Property type assessment:**
- **Single-family residence (SFR)**: Broadest buyer pool, easiest to wholesale
- **Multi-family (2-4 units)**: Smaller buyer pool, higher profit potential
- **Multi-family (5+ units)**: Commercial financing required, specialized buyers only
- **Condos/townhomes**: Check HOA restrictions on rentals and investor purchases
- **Mobile homes**: Verify if land is included, many buyers avoid these
- **Land**: Different buyer pool entirely, longer sale timeline

Match property type against your buyer list. If you don't have buyers for a property type, either skip it or build that buyer segment first.

### Basic Numbers Feasibility

Perform a 30-second mental calculation to see if numbers could work.

**Quick feasibility formula:**
Quick MAO Estimate = Estimated ARV × 0.65 - Rough Repair Estimate

If your quick MAO estimate is below or near the seller's expected price, the deal likely won't work. If there's a $20,000+ gap in your favor, proceed to Phase 2.

## Phase 2: Deep Dive (20 Minutes)

Properties passing Phase 1 deserve serious analysis. This phase requires focus and accuracy—mistakes here cost you deals or create bad ones.

### Accurate ARV with Comps

Your After Repair Value determines everything. An inaccurate ARV destroys your deal.

**Comp selection criteria:**
- **Timeline**: Sold within last 90 days (stretch to 180 days in slow markets)
- **Distance**: Within 0.5 miles (stretch to 1 mile in rural areas)
- **Size**: Within 20% of subject property square footage
- **Bed/bath**: Same bedroom and bathroom count preferred
- **Condition**: Look for renovated properties matching your projected finish level
- **Age**: Within 10 years of subject property construction date

**Required comp analysis:**
1. Pull 6-10 potential comps meeting basic criteria
2. Eliminate outliers (highest and lowest sales)
3. Select 3-5 most comparable properties
4. Adjust for differences (location, size, features, condition)
5. Calculate weighted average based on similarity

**Standard adjustments per difference:**
- Bedroom: +/- $5,000-$15,000
- Bathroom: +/- $3,000-$8,000
- Square footage: +/- $30-$100 per square foot (market dependent)
- Garage: +/- $5,000-$15,000
- Pool: +/- $10,000-$25,000
- Lot size: Varies significantly by market

### Repair Scope Estimation

You need accurate repair numbers, not guesses. Underestimating repairs kills your credibility and deals.

**Repair estimation approach:**

**Level 1 - Cosmetic Rehab ($15-$25/sq ft):**
- Paint interior and exterior
- New flooring (LVP or carpet)
- Update fixtures and hardware
- Light landscaping
- Basic cleaning and repairs

**Level 2 - Standard Rehab ($25-$45/sq ft):**
- Everything in Level 1
- Kitchen cabinet refacing or replacement
- New countertops
- Updated appliances
- Bathroom updates (vanity, toilet, fixtures)
- Minor electrical and plumbing updates

**Level 3 - Full Renovation ($45-$75/sq ft):**
- Everything in Levels 1 and 2
- Full kitchen remodel
- Full bathroom remodel(s)
- HVAC replacement
- Roof repair or replacement
- Foundation work
- Major electrical or plumbing updates
- Structural modifications

**Pro tip**: Always add a 10-15% contingency buffer to your repair estimate. Unknown issues surface in every renovation.

### Title Search and Lien Check

Title problems kill deals. Identify issues early before investing more time.

**Items to verify:**
- **Mortgage liens**: First, second, HELOCs
- **Tax liens**: Property tax, IRS, state tax liens
- **Judgment liens**: Civil judgments against owner
- **Mechanic's liens**: Unpaid contractor work
- **HOA liens**: Unpaid association dues
- **Code enforcement liens**: Municipal violation fines
- **Chain of title**: Verify clean ownership transfer history

**Red flags requiring deeper investigation:**
- Multiple liens from different creditors
- Recent quit claim deeds
- Ownership transfers between family members
- Properties in probate or estate proceedings
- Lis pendens filings (pending litigation)

Use a title company or title search service for preliminary reports. Cost is typically $75-$150 and saves thousands in failed deals.

### Motivation Assessment

Seller motivation determines whether a deal closes. Assess motivation through strategic questioning.

**Motivation indicators to evaluate:**
- **Timeline urgency**: "When do you need to be out of the property?"
- **Financial pressure**: "Are the payments current? Any liens we should know about?"
- **Emotional burden**: "How long have you been thinking about selling?"
- **Property condition**: "What repairs does the property need that you haven't been able to address?"
- **Life circumstances**: Job loss, divorce, inheritance, relocation, health issues

**Motivation scoring (1-10):**
- 9-10: Desperate situation, needs to sell immediately
- 7-8: Strong motivation, willing to discount significantly
- 5-6: Moderate motivation, might accept reasonable offer
- 3-4: Testing the market, not truly motivated
- 1-2: Fishing for retail price, not a wholesale candidate

**Rule of thumb**: Deals with motivation scores below 6 rarely close. Focus your energy on highly motivated sellers.

### Exit Strategy Determination

Know exactly how you'll monetize the deal before making an offer.

**Primary exit strategies:**
1. **Cash buyer assignment**: Assign contract to rehabber for fee ($5,000-$25,000+)
2. **Landlord/rental buyer assignment**: Assign to buy-and-hold investor
3. **Double close**: Purchase and immediately resell (for larger spreads or when assignment isn't possible)
4. **Novation agreement**: Seller agrees to your buyer, you facilitate transaction for fee
5. **Wholetail**: Light cleanup and list on MLS (requires ability to close)
6. **Owner financing flip**: Create note and sell the note or property

Identify your primary exit and at least one backup. If you can't identify two viable exits, reconsider the deal.

### Deal Structure Options

Different situations call for different contract structures.

**Structure options to consider:**
- **Standard assignment**: Most common, assign your purchase contract
- **Double close**: Required when assignment prohibited or spread is large
- **Subject-to existing financing**: Take over payments on existing mortgage
- **Seller financing**: Seller carries note, you control property
- **Lease-option**: Control property through lease with purchase option
- **Land contract**: Installment sale structure

Choose the structure that best serves the seller's situation and your exit strategy.

## Phase 3: Offer Preparation

You've done the analysis. Now create an offer that wins deals while protecting your profit margin.

### MAO Calculation

Maximum Allowable Offer is your ceiling price. Never exceed it emotionally.

**Standard MAO Formula:**
MAO = (ARV × 70%) - Repair Costs - Your Assignment Fee

**Conservative MAO Formula (recommended):**
MAO = (ARV × 65%) - Repair Costs - Your Assignment Fee

**Example calculation:**
- ARV: $250,000
- Repairs: $35,000
- Desired assignment fee: $15,000

Standard MAO = ($250,000 × 0.70) - $35,000 - $15,000 = $125,000
Conservative MAO = ($250,000 × 0.65) - $35,000 - $15,000 = $112,500

Your offer range: $112,500 to $125,000

### Tiered Offer Strategy

Never present a single number. Tiered offers increase acceptance rates dramatically.

**Three-tier offer structure:**

**Tier 1 - Cash Offer (Lowest Price, Fastest Close):**
"We can close in 14 days, all cash, you pay no commissions or closing costs."
Price: Your conservative MAO

**Tier 2 - Flexible Terms Offer (Mid Price, Seller Convenience):**
"We can close on your timeline, handle any cleanout, and work around your schedule."
Price: MAO + $5,000-$10,000

**Tier 3 - Highest Offer (Creative Structure):**
"If you can carry financing for 12 months, we can offer significantly more."
Price: MAO + $15,000-$25,000 (offset by financing terms)

Present all three options. Let sellers choose based on their priorities.

### Offer Documentation

Professional documentation separates successful wholesalers from amateurs.

**Complete offer package includes:**
1. **Purchase agreement**: State-compliant contract with assignment clause
2. **Proof of funds**: Bank statement, private lender letter, or transactional funding commitment
3. **Earnest money**: Typically $500-$2,500 (or more for larger deals)
4. **Credibility kit**: Company info, testimonials, past transaction examples
5. **Seller net sheet**: Show seller their exact proceeds after all costs

### Go/No-Go Decision Framework

Before finalizing your offer, run through this decision matrix.

**Go indicators (need 4+ of these):**
- [ ] Minimum 30% equity confirmed
- [ ] ARV verified with 3+ solid comps
- [ ] Repair estimate validated
- [ ] Seller motivation score 6+
- [ ] Clear title or solvable title issues
- [ ] Two viable exit strategies identified
- [ ] MAO provides minimum $10,000 profit potential
- [ ] Property type matches active buyer demand

**Automatic No-Go indicators (any one kills the deal):**
- Equity below 25% without creative structure
- Seller motivation score below 4
- Unsolvable title issues (disputed ownership, complex probate)
- No viable exit strategy
- MAO below seller's firm minimum price

### Deal Scoring Rubric

Score every deal before making an offer. This creates objectivity and consistency.

**Deal Scoring Matrix (100 points possible):**

| Category | Weight | Score Range |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Equity Position | 25 pts | 25=40%+, 20=35-40%, 15=30-35%, 0=<30% |
| Seller Motivation | 25 pts | 25=9-10, 20=7-8, 15=5-6, 5=3-4, 0=1-2 |
| ARV Confidence | 15 pts | 15=High, 10=Medium, 5=Low |
| Repair Clarity | 15 pts | 15=Clear scope, 10=Some unknowns, 5=Many unknowns |
| Exit Strategy | 10 pts | 10=Multiple exits, 5=Single exit, 0=No clear exit |
| Title Condition | 10 pts | 10=Clean, 7=Minor issues, 3=Major issues, 0=Unclear |

**Score interpretation:**
- 80-100: Excellent deal, pursue aggressively
- 60-79: Good deal, standard pursuit
- 40-59: Marginal deal, proceed cautiously
- Below 40: Walk away

## Examples

### Example 1: Strong Deal Evaluation

**Property**: 1847 Oak Street, 3BR/2BA, 1,450 sq ft, built 1978

**Phase 1 Quick Screen:**
- Equity check: Zillow estimate $185,000, mortgage balance $72,000 = 61% equity ✓
- Ownership duration: 18 years ✓
- Owner type: Absentee owner (mailing address different) ✓
- Property type: SFR, matches buyer pool ✓
- Quick feasibility: $185,000 × 0.65 = $120,250 - ~$25,000 repairs = $95,250 MAO estimate

**Phase 2 Deep Dive:**
- ARV confirmed at $190,000 (3 comps: $185K, $192K, $193K)
- Repairs estimated at $28,000 (Level 2 rehab, dated kitchen/baths)
- Title: Clean, no issues
- Motivation: Score 8/10 (inherited property, lives out of state, tired landlord)
- Exit strategies: Cash buyer assignment (primary), landlord buyer (secondary)

**Phase 3 Offer:**
- MAO: ($190,000 × 0.70) - $28,000 - $12,000 fee = $93,000
- Tier 1 offer: $88,000 cash, 14-day close
- Tier 2 offer: $93,000, 30-day close, seller timeline
- Tier 3 offer: $105,000 with 12-month seller financing

**Deal score**: 87/100 — Excellent deal, pursue aggressively

### Example 2: Marginal Deal Evaluation

**Property**: 592 Elm Avenue, 4BR/2BA, 1,800 sq ft, built 1985

**Phase 1 Quick Screen:**
- Equity check: Estimated value $220,000, mortgage $155,000 = 30% equity (borderline)
- Ownership duration: 7 years ✓
- Owner type: Owner-occupied
- Property type: SFR ✓
- Quick feasibility: Tight margins, needs high motivation

**Phase 2 Deep Dive:**
- ARV confirmed at $225,000
- Repairs: $22,000 (mostly cosmetic)
- Title: Second mortgage discovered, total liens = $168,000
- Motivation: Score 5/10 (wants to sell but not urgent)
- Exit strategies: Cash buyer only viable exit

**Phase 3 Analysis:**
- MAO: ($225,000 × 0.70) - $22,000 - $10,000 = $125,500
- Available equity for deal: $225,000 - $168,000 = $57,000
- Maximum realistic offer: $168,000 + closing costs ≈ $175,000

**Deal score**: 48/100 — Marginal deal. The MAO of $125,500 is below the lien amount of $168,000. This deal only works if the seller accepts a significant loss or brings money to closing. With motivation at 5/10, this is unlikely. **Decision: Pass on this deal.**

## Common Mistakes

1. **Skipping the quick screen**: Spending 30 minutes analyzing a property with 15% equity wastes your most valuable resource—time.

2. **Using Zillow as your only ARV source**: Zillow's Zestimate can be off by 10-20%. Always verify with actual sold comps.

3. **Underestimating repairs to make deals work**: Fudging repair numbers to hit your MAO creates deals that fall apart or damage your reputation.

4. **Ignoring title issues**: A property with a $30,000 IRS lien you didn't discover will cost you your earnest money and buyer relationship.

5. **Confusing interest with motivation**: A seller who takes your call isn't necessarily motivated. Score motivation based on their situation, not their willingness to talk.

6. **Single-price offers**: Presenting one number gives sellers nothing to consider. Tiered offers let them choose and increase acceptance rates.

7. **Skipping the credibility kit**: Sellers receive multiple offers. The most professional presentation wins, even at a slightly lower price.

8. **Emotional attachment to deals**: When numbers don't work, walk away. One bad deal can erase profits from five good ones.

9. **Not having multiple exit strategies**: If your only buyer passes, what then? Always identify backup exits before committing.

10. **Rushing Phase 2 for "hot" deals**: Urgency is often manufactured. Take your 20 minutes. Mistakes made in due diligence are expensive.
