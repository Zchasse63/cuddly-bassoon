# Quick Property Analysis: The 2-Minute Deal Screen and Desktop Due Diligence Guide

## Quick Reference

- **The 2-minute screen determines if a lead deserves 20 more minutes of research**—never spend hours on a deal before passing this initial filter
- **Use the 70% rule as your instant filter**: MAO = (ARV × 0.70) - Repairs - Assignment Fee
- **Google Street View date matters**—always check when imagery was captured; conditions change dramatically in 2-3 years
- **Satellite view reveals what sellers hide**: unpermitted additions, pool issues, lot encroachments, and drainage problems
- **Tax assessed value typically runs 70-90% of market value** in most markets—use local multipliers for quick ARV estimates
- **Red flags on desktop research kill 40% of deals**—finding them early saves hours of wasted effort
- **Batch your research in groups of 5-10 leads** for maximum efficiency—context switching destroys productivity
- **The "3 browser tab rule"**: If you need more than 3 tabs open to research a lead, you're overcomplicating initial screening
- **Document everything with screenshots**—you'll need this information when making offers and talking to buyers

## The 2-Minute Deal Screen Process

The 2-minute deal screen is your first line of defense against time-wasting leads. Your goal isn't to fully analyze every property—it's to quickly eliminate obvious non-starters and identify leads worth deeper investigation.

### The 5-Point Rapid Assessment

**Point 1: Quick ARV Estimation (30 seconds)**
Pull up Zillow, Redfin, or Realtor.com. Look at the automated estimate and the estimate range. Check 2-3 recent sales on the same street or immediate area. You're not calculating a precise ARV—you're establishing a ballpark.

Example: Zillow shows $285,000 estimate with a range of $265,000-$305,000. Two houses on the street sold for $275,000 and $290,000 in the last 6 months. Working ARV for screening: $280,000.

**Point 2: Repair Range Assessment (30 seconds)**
Based on any available photos and property age, assign a repair tier:
- **Light**: $10,000-$25,000 (cosmetic updates only)
- **Medium**: $25,000-$50,000 (kitchen, baths, flooring, paint)
- **Heavy**: $50,000-$100,000 (major systems, structural elements)
- **Full gut**: $100,000+ (complete renovation)

**Point 3: MAO Calculation (15 seconds)**
Using the 70% rule: MAO = ($280,000 × 0.70) - $40,000 repairs - $10,000 assignment = $146,000

**Point 4: Asking Price or Motivation Check (30 seconds)**
Is the seller's asking price (if stated) anywhere near your MAO? What's their motivation level? A seller asking $250,000 when your MAO is $146,000 is likely a dead lead without extreme motivation.

**Point 5: Exit Strategy Viability (15 seconds)**
Can you wholesale this? Is there buyer demand in this area and price point? A $500,000 ARV property in a slow luxury market is harder to move than a $200,000 property in an active investor neighborhood.

### The Screen Decision Matrix

| ARV Confidence | Price Alignment | Motivation | Decision |
|----------------|-----------------|------------|----------|
| High | Within 20% of MAO | High | **Deep dive immediately** |
| High | Within 20% of MAO | Unknown | **Research, then call** |
| Medium | Within 30% of MAO | High | **Quick research, then call** |
| Medium | 30%+ above MAO | High | **Call to negotiate** |
| Low | Any | Any | **Get more info before proceeding** |
| Any | 50%+ above MAO | Low | **Move on** |

## Desktop Due Diligence Checklist

Once a lead passes the 2-minute screen, use this systematic checklist to gather the information you need before making contact or making an offer.

### Property Identification Verification
- [ ] Confirm property address matches parcel data
- [ ] Verify legal description and parcel number
- [ ] Check that square footage matches listing/tax records
- [ ] Confirm bedroom/bathroom count
- [ ] Verify lot size and boundaries

### Ownership and Title Indicators
- [ ] Current owner name(s) on record
- [ ] Length of ownership (when did they acquire?)
- [ ] How they acquired (purchase, inheritance, quit claim)
- [ ] Mailing address vs. property address (owner-occupied or rental?)
- [ ] Any obvious liens or judgments visible in public records

### Financial Status Signals
- [ ] Current on property taxes or delinquent
- [ ] Tax amount (indicates assessed value)
- [ ] Any tax liens recorded
- [ ] Foreclosure status (pre-foreclosure, NOD, scheduled auction)
- [ ] HOA status if applicable

### Property Condition Indicators
- [ ] Year built and construction type
- [ ] Last sale price and date
- [ ] Any recent permits pulled
- [ ] Flood zone designation
- [ ] Zoning classification

## Using Google Street View Effectively

Google Street View is one of your most powerful free tools. Used properly, it reveals property condition details that even listing photos hide.

### The Street View Assessment Process

**Step 1: Check the Capture Date**
Before analyzing anything, click on the image date in the top-left corner. Street View imagery can be 1-7 years old. A house that looked fine in 2019 might be completely different in 2024. If imagery is more than 2 years old, reduce your confidence in the visual assessment.

**Step 2: Full Property Perimeter**
Navigate around the property to see all visible sides. Many problems are only visible from specific angles:
- Walk virtually down the street in both directions
- Check cross streets for side/rear views
- Look for alleys that might show the back of the property

**Step 3: Systematic Condition Assessment**

**Roof Inspection:**
- Missing or curling shingles (visible as color inconsistencies)
- Sagging rooflines (structural concern—major red flag)
- Multiple layers visible at edges
- Algae/moss growth (indicates moisture retention)
- Chimney condition and flashing

**Foundation Indicators:**
- Cracks in visible foundation walls
- Stair-step cracks in brick veneer
- Doors/windows that appear out of square
- Separation between porch and main structure
- Settling or sinking visible in the foundation line

**Exterior Condition:**
- Siding condition (peeling paint, rotting wood, damaged vinyl)
- Window frames (rotting, painted shut, fogged glass)
- Gutters (missing, sagging, disconnected)
- Fascia and soffit condition

**Landscaping and Maintenance Signals:**
- Overgrown vegetation (indicates vacancy or neglect)
- Dead trees (removal costs $500-$3,000)
- Broken fencing
- Driveway condition (cracks, heaving, staining)
- General curb appeal

### Neighborhood Quality Assessment

While viewing the subject property, assess the surrounding area:
- Condition of neighboring homes (pride of ownership?)
- Vehicles parked on street (quality and quantity)
- Commercial intrusion (is that a business next door?)
- Vacant lots or boarded properties nearby
- Street condition and infrastructure

**Pro Tip:** Use the historical imagery feature (clock icon) to see how the property and neighborhood have changed over time. A neighborhood improving over 5 years is very different from one declining.

## Satellite View for Lot and Neighborhood Assessment

Switch to satellite view to see what Street View can't show you.

### Property-Level Analysis

**Lot Assessment:**
- Actual lot boundaries and size
- Usable vs. unusable land (slopes, wetlands)
- Driveway length and parking areas
- Outbuildings (sheds, detached garages, workshops)

**Hidden Features:**
- Swimming pools (look for blue rectangles)
- Tennis courts or other improvements
- Unpermitted additions (compare building footprint to tax records)
- Rear yard condition

**Problem Indicators:**
- Standing water or drainage issues (darker areas)
- Erosion patterns
- Encroachments from neighboring properties
- Easements (visible utility paths, pipelines)
- Proximity to retention ponds, power lines, or commercial areas

### Neighborhood-Level Analysis

**Positive Signals:**
- Well-maintained pools in multiple yards
- Consistent lot sizes and home styles
- Green, maintained lawns throughout
- Cul-de-sacs and limited through traffic

**Warning Signals:**
- Multiple vacant lots or demolished structures
- Large commercial or industrial facilities nearby
- Railroad tracks within 500 feet
- Highways or major roads adjacent
- Irregular lot shapes suggesting problem parcels

## Quick Value Estimation Without Comps

Sometimes you need a quick value estimate before pulling actual comparable sales. Use these methods for initial screening only.

### Tax Assessment Multiplier Method

Most jurisdictions assess property at 70-100% of market value. Learn your local multiplier:

**Formula:** Estimated Value = Tax Assessed Value × Local Multiplier

**Example Market Multipliers:**
- Florida: Assessed values often 80-90% of market (multiply by 1.1-1.25)
- Texas: Usually close to market value (multiply by 1.0-1.1)
- California: Prop 13 means assessments lag significantly (multiply by 1.5-2.0+ for long-term owners)

**Example Calculation:**
Tax assessed value: $180,000
Local multiplier: 1.2 (based on recent sales analysis)
Quick estimated value: $180,000 × 1.2 = $216,000

### Price Per Square Foot Method

If you know neighborhood values, use price per square foot for quick estimates:

**Formula:** Estimated Value = Square Footage × Neighborhood $/SF

Research the average price per square foot for the neighborhood using Zillow, Redfin, or recent sales. Adjust for condition.

**Example:**
Subject property: 1,800 SF
Neighborhood average: $165/SF for renovated homes
Condition adjustment: -15% for dated property
Quick estimate: 1,800 × $165 × 0.85 = $252,450

### Automated Valuation Cross-Reference

Pull estimates from multiple sources and look for consensus:
- Zillow Zestimate
- Redfin Estimate
- Realtor.com Estimate
- County tax assessment

If three sources cluster around $275,000-$290,000 with one outlier at $315,000, your working ARV is likely in the $280,000-$285,000 range.

**Warning:** Never rely solely on automated estimates. They're starting points, not conclusions.

## Estimating Repairs from Photos

When listing photos or seller photos are available, you can estimate repairs without visiting the property.

### The Photo Analysis Framework

**Kitchen Assessment:**
- Cabinets: Style indicates age (oak = 1990s, flat panel = 2000s+)
- Countertops: Laminate vs. granite/quartz
- Appliances: White/black vs. stainless, condition
- Flooring: Vinyl, tile, or hardwood
- Kitchen budget: $8,000-$15,000 (light refresh) to $25,000-$45,000 (full renovation)

**Bathroom Assessment:**
- Vanity style and condition
- Toilet (round vs. elongated, water stains)
- Tub/shower (fiberglass vs. tile, condition of caulk and grout)
- Flooring type and condition
- Bathroom budget: $3,000-$6,000 (refresh) to $8,000-$15,000 (full renovation)

**Flooring Throughout:**
- Carpet age (matted, stained, outdated color)
- Hardwood condition (scratches, gaps, finish wear)
- Tile condition (cracked, dated)
- Flooring budget: $3-$8 per square foot installed

**Paint and Walls:**
- Wallpaper (removal adds cost)
- Bold colors requiring multiple coats
- Visible damage (holes, water stains)
- Textured ceilings (popcorn removal is expensive)
- Paint budget: $1.50-$3 per square foot

### Condition Tier Quick Estimates

| Condition | Signs | Typical Budget |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Cosmetic | Dated but functional, needs paint/carpet | $15,000-$25,000 |
| Moderate | Needs kitchen/bath updates, flooring | $25,000-$45,000 |
| Significant | Systems issues, structural repairs | $45,000-$75,000 |
| Major | Gut renovation, code issues | $75,000-$125,000+ |

## Public Records Quick Research

Access these public data sources to gather essential property intelligence quickly.

### County Assessor/Property Appraiser
**What you'll find:** Owner name, mailing address, assessed value, tax history, legal description, property characteristics, sales history

**What to look for:** 
- Tax delinquency (motivated seller indicator)
- Length of ownership (equity position)
- Mailing address different from property (landlord or inherited)

### County Recorder/Clerk
**What you'll find:** Recorded documents including deeds, mortgages, liens, judgments

**What to look for:**
- Recent refinances (may have extracted equity)
- Lis pendens (pending litigation)
- Mechanic's liens (contractor disputes)
- IRS liens, judgment liens

### Court Records
**What you'll find:** Civil and criminal cases, divorce proceedings, probate cases, foreclosure filings

**What to look for:**
- Foreclosure cases (motivation level, timeline)
- Divorce filings (forced sale possible)
- Probate cases (inherited property, multiple heirs)

### Building/Permit Department
**What you'll find:** Permit history, code violations, occupancy status

**What to look for:**
- Open permits (must be closed before sale)
- Unpermitted work (additions not matching tax records)
- Code violations (must be resolved)

## Red Flags Visible from Desktop Research

These warning signs should make you dig deeper or walk away entirely:

### Title and Ownership Red Flags
- **Multiple owners on deed** (all must sign, creates complications)
- **Recent quit claim deed** (may indicate undisclosed issues)
- **Corporate or trust ownership** (need to identify decision maker)
- **Recently inherited** (potential probate issues, multiple heirs)
- **IRS or state tax liens** (must be satisfied at closing)

### Physical Property Red Flags
- **Foundation cracks visible in photos** (structural engineer needed)
- **Roof sagging** (potential structural failure)
- **Fire damage indicators** (insurance complications)
- **Mold visible in photos** (remediation costs add up fast)
- **Addition not matching tax records** (unpermitted work)

### Location Red Flags
- **Flood zone designation** (insurance costs, buyer pool limitation)
- **Commercial zoning nearby** (future development concerns)
- **Multiple vacant properties on street** (neighborhood decline)
- **Adjacent to highway or railroad** (noise, limited buyer appeal)

### Situation Red Flags
- **Property in active foreclosure** (timeline constraints)
- **Listed with an agent while contacting you** (ethics and contract issues)
- **Tenant-occupied with unknown lease terms** (possession complications)
- **Open code violations** (must be resolved pre-sale)

## When to Dig Deeper vs Move On

Your time is your most valuable asset. Use this decision framework to allocate research time wisely.

### Dig Deeper When:
- Initial numbers show 15%+ potential profit margin
- Seller motivation is clearly high (pre-foreclosure, divorce, inherited)
- Property is in a strong investor market
- Red flags are manageable (minor title issues, cosmetic damage)
- You have buyer demand for this property type

### Move On When:
- Seller expectations exceed MAO by 30%+ with low motivation
- Multiple major red flags present (structural + title + location)
- Property sits in a slow or declining market
- Your buyer list has no demand for this property type
- Better opportunities are waiting in your pipeline

### The "Rule of 10" Decision Process
Ask yourself: "Are there 10 things right about this deal?" If you can't list 10 positives (location, price potential, motivation, condition, market demand, timeline, seller cooperation, clear title, exit options, profit margin), move to the next lead.

## Efficient Research Workflow

Maximize your throughput by organizing your research process systematically.

### Batch Processing Protocol

**Step 1: Lead Collection (Morning)**
Gather all new leads into a single spreadsheet or CRM view. Don't research them one by one as they arrive.

**Step 2: 2-Minute Screen Batch (30 minutes)**
Run through 10-15 leads doing only the 2-minute screen. Tag each as:
- Green: Strong potential, deep dive needed
- Yellow: Possible opportunity, needs verification
- Red: Dead lead, move on

**Step 3: Deep Research Batch (1-2 hours)**
Take your green and yellow leads and run through the full desktop due diligence checklist. Batch by task:
- Open all county assessor records in tabs
- Research all properties, then close tabs
- Open all Google Street Views
- Assess all properties, then close tabs
- Continue through each research category

### Browser Setup for Speed

**Bookmark Toolbar Organization:**
- County property appraiser
- County recorder
- Court records search
- Zillow
- Redfin
- Google Maps

**Tab Management:**
Limit yourself to 3-5 tabs per property. More tabs means you're overcomplicating initial analysis.

### Documentation System

Create a standard notes template for each lead:
```
Property: [Address]
Date Screened: [Date]
ARV Estimate: $[Amount] (Source: [How you estimated])
Repair Estimate: $[Amount] (Tier: [Light/Medium/Heavy])
MAO: $[Amount]
Owner: [Name] - Owned since [Year]
Red Flags: [List any]
Green Flags: [List any]
Next Step: [Action]
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick Screen Pass
**Property:** 1847 Maple Street, 3BR/2BA, 1,450 SF, built 1978

**2-Minute Screen:**
- Zillow estimate: $195,000 (range $185,000-$210,000)
- Street view shows: Dated exterior, roof appears worn, overgrown yard
- Repair estimate: Medium tier ($35,000)
- MAO: ($195,000 × 0.70) - $35,000 - $10,000 = $91,500
- Seller asking: $95,000 (motivated—pre-foreclosure lead)
- Market: Active investor area, strong rental demand

**Decision:** GREEN LIGHT—proceed to full desktop due diligence

### Example 2: Quick Screen Fail
**Property:** 892 Oak Boulevard, 4BR/3BA, 2,800 SF, built 2005

**2-Minute Screen:**
- Zillow estimate: $425,000
- Street view shows: Well-maintained, recent landscaping
- Repair estimate: Light ($15,000)
- MAO: ($425,000 × 0.70) - $15,000 - $15,000 = $267,500
- Seller asking: $380,000 (inherited property, not urgent)
- Market: Retail buyer market, few investors

**Decision:** RED—move on. Seller expectation is $112,500 above MAO with low motivation and limited buyer pool.

### Example 3: Yellow Light Requiring Verification
**Property:** 234 Cedar Lane, 3BR/1BA, 1,100 SF, built 1962

**2-Minute Screen:**
- Zillow estimate: $165,000 (but low confidence rating)
- Street view shows: Can't tell—imagery from 2018
- Repair estimate: Unknown without current photos
- Owner: Trust ownership (inherited?)
- Seller inquiry: "Just want to know what it's worth"

**Decision:** YELLOW—request current photos, verify motivation level, then reassess. Don't invest deep research time until motivation is confirmed.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Spending 30 minutes on a lead before doing the 2-minute screen** - Always filter first, research second

2. **Trusting old Street View imagery** - A lot changes in 3-5 years; always check capture dates

3. **Ignoring the neighborhood during property research** - The best-renovated house on a declining street is still a hard sell

4. **Using only one ARV source** - Cross-reference multiple automated estimates and verify with actual sales data

5. **Underestimating repairs from photos** - If anything, add 10-20% to photo-based estimates for hidden issues

6. **Missing title red flags in public records** - Liens, multiple owners, and pending litigation kill deals

7. **Researching leads one at a time as they arrive** - Batch processing is 3-4x more efficient

8. **Over-researching before seller contact** - Get basic screening done, then verify details through seller conversation

9. **Falling in love with a property before completing due diligence** - Emotional attachment clouds judgment

10. **Not documenting research findings** - You'll forget details and waste time re-researching the same properties
