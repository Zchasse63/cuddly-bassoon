# Complete Guide to Evaluating Distressed Properties for Wholesaling

## Quick Reference

- **Three types of distress exist**: physical (property condition), financial (owner circumstances), and legal (liens, violations, title issues)—each affects your evaluation and deal structure differently
- **Foundation repairs typically cost $5,000-$50,000+**; always look for stair-step cracks, horizontal cracks, and doors/windows that won't close properly
- **Roof replacement runs $8,000-$25,000** for standard residential; missing shingles, sagging ridgelines, and daylight through boards are immediate red flags
- **Environmental hazards (mold, asbestos, lead) can add $5,000-$75,000** to rehab costs and require licensed remediation
- **Code violations reduce property value** by 1.5-2x the cost of repairs due to holding time, permits, and inspection delays
- **Uninhabitable properties require 20-40% deeper discounts** to account for extended timelines and financing limitations
- **Adjust ARV downward 5-15%** for stigmatized properties (fire damage, hoarding, crime scenes) even after full renovation
- **Heavily distressed properties often require subject-to or seller financing** because traditional assignment deals rarely work at necessary discount levels

## Understanding Types of Property Distress

### Physical Distress

Physical distress refers to the actual condition of the property. This is what most wholesalers focus on, but it's only one piece of the puzzle. Physical distress ranges from cosmetic issues (outdated kitchens, worn carpet) to catastrophic problems (structural failure, fire damage, environmental contamination).

**Key physical distress categories:**
- Structural damage (foundation, framing, load-bearing walls)
- System failures (HVAC, electrical, plumbing)
- Environmental hazards (mold, asbestos, lead paint)
- Weather damage (fire, flood, wind, hail)
- Neglect and deferred maintenance
- Vandalism and theft (copper stripping, fixture removal)

### Financial Distress

Financial distress relates to the owner's situation, not the property itself. A financially distressed owner may have a property in perfect condition but face circumstances that create motivation to sell below market value.

**Common financial distress indicators:**
- Pre-foreclosure or notice of default filed
- Tax liens or delinquent property taxes
- Bankruptcy filing (Chapter 7 or 13)
- Probate situations with estate debts
- Divorce requiring asset liquidation
- Job loss, medical bills, or sudden income reduction

### Legal Distress

Legal distress involves encumbrances, violations, or title issues that complicate ownership or sale. These properties often sit on market longer and require specialized knowledge to navigate.

**Legal distress examples:**
- Outstanding code violations with daily fines
- Mechanic's liens from unpaid contractors
- HOA liens with super-lien status
- Clouded title from missing heirs or improper conveyances
- Pending litigation involving the property
- Condemnation proceedings

**Pro tip:** The most profitable deals often combine multiple distress types. A property with foundation issues (physical), owned by someone in pre-foreclosure (financial), with outstanding code violations (legal) creates maximum motivation and maximum discount potential—but also maximum complexity.

## Evaluating Structural Issues from Exterior

You can identify 70-80% of major structural problems without ever entering the property. This skill is essential for drive-by evaluations and initial screening.

### What to Look For

**Roofline assessment:**
- Sagging or wavy ridgeline indicates truss or rafter failure
- Chimney leaning away from house suggests foundation movement
- Visible daylight through roof boards from street level

**Wall inspection:**
- Bowing or bulging walls signal structural failure
- Diagonal cracks at window corners indicate settling
- Separation between brick veneer and window frames

**Foundation visibility:**
- Exposed foundation showing cracks
- Gaps between foundation and siding
- Retaining walls leaning or failing

**Ground-level indicators:**
- Improper grading (soil sloping toward foundation)
- Standing water near foundation
- Large trees within 10 feet of foundation

**Door and window alignment:**
- Gaps visible around closed doors
- Windows that appear crooked in frames
- Recent caulking attempting to hide gaps

## Foundation Problem Indicators

Foundation issues are deal-killers for inexperienced investors. As a wholesaler, you need to accurately identify and communicate these problems to your buyers.

### Crack Classification System

**Hairline cracks (< 1/8 inch):** Usually cosmetic from normal settling. Repair cost: $300-$1,000.

**Minor cracks (1/8 to 1/4 inch):** Monitor for movement. May indicate ongoing settling. Repair cost: $1,000-$3,000.

**Moderate cracks (1/4 to 1/2 inch):** Structural concern requiring professional evaluation. Repair cost: $3,000-$15,000.

**Severe cracks (> 1/2 inch):** Significant structural failure. Often requires pier installation or wall replacement. Repair cost: $15,000-$50,000+.

### Critical Crack Patterns

**Stair-step cracks in brick or block:** Follow mortar joints in a stair pattern. Indicate differential settling. Severity depends on width and location.

**Horizontal cracks:** Most serious type. Indicate lateral pressure from soil, water, or frost. Often require wall stabilization or replacement. Budget $10,000-$30,000 minimum.

**Vertical cracks:** Less concerning than horizontal but still require evaluation. Often result from shrinkage or minor settling.

**Diagonal cracks from corners:** Indicate stress concentration. Common at window and door corners. Usually repairable for $2,000-$8,000.

### Interior Foundation Clues

- Doors that won't latch or swing open on their own
- Cracks in drywall at ceiling-wall junctions
- Sloping floors (use a marble test or level)
- Gaps between walls and ceiling or floor
- Basement water intrusion or efflorescence (white mineral deposits)

## Roof Condition Assessment

Roofs are the second most expensive system to replace after foundations. Your evaluation determines whether a property is a light rehab or a major project.

### Roof Age and Material Lifespan

| Material | Expected Lifespan | Replacement Cost (2,000 sq ft) |
|----------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| 3-Tab Asphalt | 15-20 years | $8,000-$12,000 |
| Architectural Shingles | 25-30 years | $10,000-$16,000 |
| Metal | 40-70 years | $18,000-$30,000 |
| Tile/Slate | 50-100 years | $25,000-$50,000 |
| Flat (Modified Bitumen) | 15-20 years | $6,000-$12,000 |

### Red Flags Visible from Ground

- **Missing or curling shingles:** Immediate replacement candidate
- **Moss or algae growth:** Indicates moisture retention and shortened lifespan
- **Sagging roof deck:** Structural failure requiring deck replacement, adding $3,000-$8,000
- **Multiple layers visible at edges:** May require tear-off, adding $1,500-$3,500
- **Flashing deterioration:** Especially around chimneys, vents, and valleys
- **Gutter condition:** Detached, rusted, or overflowing gutters cause fascia rot

### Interior Roof Damage Signs

- Water stains on ceilings (brown rings indicate active or recent leaks)
- Daylight visible through attic roof boards
- Sagging or soft spots in ceiling drywall
- Mold growth in attic space
- Insulation displacement from water intrusion

## Electrical and Plumbing Red Flags

Systems issues are often hidden but create significant cost exposure. Know what questions to ask and what clues to observe.

### Electrical Warning Signs

**Panel concerns:**
- Federal Pacific or Zinsco panels: Require replacement ($1,500-$3,500)
- Fuse boxes: Acceptable but often require upgrade for insurance ($2,000-$4,000)
- Double-tapped breakers: Safety issue requiring correction
- Burned or corroded wiring visible at panel

**Throughout property:**
- Knob and tube wiring: Often uninsurable, replacement costs $8,000-$15,000+
- Aluminum wiring (1965-1973): Requires pigtailing or replacement, $2,000-$8,000
- Two-prong outlets: May indicate ungrounded system
- Extension cords used as permanent wiring
- Flickering lights or warm outlet covers

### Plumbing Red Flags

**Supply line issues:**
- Polybutylene pipes (gray plastic, 1978-1995): Notorious for failure, replacement $4,000-$12,000
- Galvanized steel pipes: Rust from inside, often require replacement in homes 50+ years old
- Low water pressure at multiple fixtures: Indicates supply line problems
- Visible corrosion at shut-off valves

**Drain line concerns:**
- Slow drains throughout house: May indicate main line issues
- Orangeburg sewer pipe (pre-1970): Paper-based pipe requiring replacement, $3,000-$10,000+
- Cast iron drain lines showing rust or holes
- Sewage smell without obvious source
- Foundation cracks near drain line paths

**Water heater:**
- Age over 10-12 years: Budget for replacement ($1,200-$2,500)
- Rust at base or connections
- No expansion tank in closed systems

## Environmental Concerns: Mold, Asbestos, and Lead

Environmental hazards can transform a profitable deal into a liability nightmare. Know the rules and costs.

### Mold Assessment

Mold requires three things: moisture, organic material, and time. Focus your evaluation on moisture sources.

**Common mold locations:**
- Bathrooms (especially around tubs and under sinks)
- Basements and crawl spaces
- Around HVAC systems
- Near water heaters
- Under kitchen sinks
- Around window frames with condensation issues

**Mold remediation costs:**
- Small area (< 10 sq ft): $500-$1,500
- Moderate (10-100 sq ft): $1,500-$5,000
- Large (100+ sq ft): $5,000-$30,000
- Whole-house remediation: $15,000-$50,000+

**Key insight:** Mold remediation without addressing the moisture source is wasted money. Always identify and budget for fixing the underlying cause.

### Asbestos Considerations

Asbestos was used extensively in building materials through 1980. Assume any home built before 1980 may contain asbestos.

**Common asbestos locations:**
- Vinyl floor tiles (9x9 inch tiles especially)
- Pipe insulation
- Popcorn ceilings (pre-1980)
- Roof shingles and siding
- HVAC duct insulation
- Joint compound and textite

**Asbestos rules:**
- Undisturbed asbestos is generally safe
- Encapsulation is often cheaper than removal
- Removal requires licensed contractors and permits
- Disposal costs are significant ($25-$75 per bag)

**Typical asbestos removal costs:**
- Pipe insulation: $15-$25 per linear foot
- Floor tiles: $5-$15 per square foot
- Popcorn ceiling: $3-$7 per square foot
- Complete abatement: $15,000-$75,000+

### Lead Paint

All homes built before 1978 may contain lead paint. Federal disclosure requirements apply.

**Lead paint considerations:**
- Testing costs $200-$500
- Encapsulation acceptable in most cases
- Removal required if paint is deteriorating
- Window and door friction surfaces are highest risk
- Renovation requires EPA RRP certification for contractors

**Remediation costs:**
- Encapsulation: $1-$3 per square foot
- Removal: $8-$15 per square foot
- Full home remediation: $5,000-$30,000

## Code Violation Impact on Value

Code violations create both direct costs (repairs) and indirect costs (time, permits, fines).

### Calculating True Violation Costs

**Formula:** Total Violation Impact = (Repair Cost × 1.5) + Outstanding Fines + Permit Costs + Holding Costs During Remediation

**Example calculation:**
- Repair cost estimate: $15,000
- Multiplier for permits and inspection delays: $15,000 × 1.5 = $22,500
- Outstanding fines: $3,200
- Additional permit costs: $800
- Holding costs (3 months at $1,500/month): $4,500
- **Total violation impact: $31,000**

### Violation Categories and Typical Impacts

**Life safety violations (highest priority):**
- Non-working smoke detectors
- Blocked egress
- Electrical hazards
- Structural instability

**Health violations:**
- Plumbing failures
- Sewage issues
- Mold/moisture problems
- Pest infestations

**Property maintenance violations:**
- Exterior deterioration
- Yard maintenance
- Unapproved structures
- Unpermitted work

**Pro tip:** Always pull the full violation history from the municipality. Some violations trigger automatic re-inspection requirements that add months to timelines.

## Uninhabitable Property Considerations

Properties declared uninhabitable by local authorities or effectively uninhabitable due to condition require special handling.

### What Makes a Property Uninhabitable

- No functional utilities (electric, water, sewer)
- Structural failure creating safety hazard
- Environmental contamination exceeding safe levels
- Active condemnation order
- Failed septic system
- Severe fire or flood damage

### Financing Implications

**Uninhabitable properties eliminate most buyer financing options:**
- Conventional loans: Require habitable condition
- FHA loans: Strict habitability requirements
- VA loans: Even stricter requirements
- Hard money: Available but at higher rates (12-18%)
- Cash buyers only: Significantly limits buyer pool

### Discount Requirements

Uninhabitable properties require 20-40% deeper discounts than comparable distressed-but-habitable properties because:
- Reduced buyer pool (cash only)
- Extended rehab timelines (permits, inspections)
- Higher carrying costs during renovation
- Increased risk for buyers

## Fire and Flood Damage Evaluation

Casualty damage requires specialized evaluation because the visible damage rarely tells the full story.

### Fire Damage Assessment

**Smoke damage considerations:**
- Smoke penetrates everything: HVAC ducts, insulation, outlets
- Odor remediation often requires ozone treatment ($500-$2,000)
- Insurance companies use "pack out" cleaning for contents
- Structural charring depth determines member replacement needs

**Fire damage cost ranges:**
- Cosmetic smoke damage (no structural): $15,000-$40,000
- Moderate fire (one room, some structural): $40,000-$100,000
- Significant fire (multiple rooms, structural): $100,000-$250,000+

**Stigma factor:** Fire-damaged properties often sell for 5-15% below normal ARV even after complete restoration due to buyer perception.

### Flood Damage Evaluation

**The "2-2-2 Rule" for flood damage:**
- 2 inches of water: Drywall replacement to 4 feet, floor coverings, base trim
- 2 feet of water: Complete first-floor gut to studs, HVAC and electrical inspection
- 2 days of standing water: Mold remediation becomes near-certain

**Hidden flood damage:**
- Subfloor swelling and delamination
- Mold in wall cavities (not visible for 48-72 hours)
- HVAC contamination
- Electrical system corrosion
- Foundation soil destabilization

**Flood damage cost ranges:**
- Minor flooding (< 2 inches, quick dry-out): $5,000-$15,000
- Moderate flooding (2 inches to 2 feet): $20,000-$60,000
- Severe flooding (> 2 feet or extended standing): $60,000-$150,000+

## Hoarder Property Assessment

Hoarder properties are increasingly common and require specific evaluation protocols.

### Initial Assessment Protocol

**Exterior indicators:**
- Items visible through windows
- Pathways through yard debris
- Garage overstuffed and inoperable
- Multiple vehicles in disrepair

**Before entering, assess:**
- Structural load concerns (floor may be compromised)
- Air quality hazards (animal waste, decomposition)
- Fire escape routes
- Pest activity levels

### Cost Components

**Cleanout costs:**
- Light hoarding (1-2 rooms affected): $1,500-$4,000
- Moderate hoarding (most rooms affected): $4,000-$12,000
- Severe hoarding (entire property, structural concern): $12,000-$35,000

**Hidden damage commonly found:**
- Pest damage (rodents, roaches, bedbugs)
- Moisture damage from blocked ventilation
- Plumbing issues from delayed maintenance
- Animal waste contamination (requires bio-hazard cleaning)

**Bio-hazard cleaning adds $2,000-$15,000 depending on severity.**

## Adjusting ARV for Major Issues

Even after repairs, certain properties carry stigma that affects resale value.

### ARV Adjustment Guidelines

| Condition | ARV Adjustment |
|-----------|----------------|
| Former meth lab | -10% to -20% |
| Fire damage (restored) | -5% to -15% |
| Murder/suicide on property | -10% to -25% |
| Severe hoarding (known in neighborhood) | -5% to -10% |
| Flood damage history | -5% to -15% |
| Former grow house | -5% to -10% |

### Disclosure Requirements

Most states require disclosure of material facts that could affect value, including:
- Deaths on property (varies by state, typically 1-3 years)
- Previous contamination and remediation
- Major casualty events
- Known structural repairs

**Pro tip:** When calculating your offer, use the adjusted ARV, not the standard comp-based ARV. Your buyer will make the same adjustment.

## Deal Structures for Heavily Distressed Properties

Traditional wholesale assignment often doesn't work for heavily distressed properties because the required discount levels are too deep.

### Why Standard Assignments Fail

For extremely distressed properties, the math often looks like this:
- ARV: $200,000
- Repairs needed: $100,000
- Buyer's required discount: 30% of ARV ($60,000)
- Maximum buyer can pay: $40,000
- Your required profit: $10,000
- Maximum offer to seller: $30,000

At $30,000 for a property the seller thinks is worth $100,000+, you won't get agreements signed.

### Alternative Deal Structures

**Subject-to existing financing:**
When the property has a mortgage, take over payments without formally assuming the loan. This works when:
- Seller owes more than your cash offer would be
- Monthly payment is manageable
- You have an end buyer lined up quickly

**Seller financing with deep discount:**
Offer the seller their price but on your terms:
- "I'll pay you $75,000—$5,000 now, and $500/month for 15 years at 0% interest"
- Creates positive cash flow while you find buyer
- Seller gets ongoing income stream

**Novation agreements:**
Replace yourself in the contract with your end buyer, eliminating double-closing costs and providing more time to find qualified buyers.

**JV partnerships:**
Partner with a rehabber who has capital:
- You find the deal and negotiate the contract
- Partner funds the purchase
- Split profits 50/50 on backend

**Lease-option to end buyer:**
Structure a lease-option to a retail buyer willing to take the property as-is:
- Collect option fee ($5,000-$15,000)
- Monthly rent covers your hold costs
- Buyer has motivation to complete repairs

## Examples

### Example 1: Foundation and Roof Issues

**Property:** 3BR/2BA ranch, built 1965
**Seller situation:** Estate sale, property vacant 2 years
**Initial appearance:** Overgrown, roof visibly damaged, cracks visible in brick

**Your evaluation:**
- Stair-step crack in foundation (3/8 inch at widest): Estimate $12,000 for pier installation
- Roof missing shingles, visible sagging: Full replacement $14,000
- HVAC non-functional: Replacement $6,000
- Cosmetic throughout: $15,000
- **Total estimated repairs: $47,000**

**Deal analysis:**
- ARV from comps: $185,000
- Buyer's required price (70% ARV - repairs): $129,500 - $47,000 = $82,500
- Your assignment fee target: $8,000
- Maximum offer to seller: $74,500

**Outcome:** Estate accepted $72,000. Assigned to investor for $80,000. $8,000 assignment fee.

### Example 2: Environmental Hazards Plus Code Violations

**Property:** 4BR/2BA two-story, built 1955
**Seller situation:** Inherited from aunt, lives out of state, discovered code violations
**Initial appearance:** Decent exterior, but city has condemned as uninhabitable

**Your evaluation:**
- Outstanding code violations: 23 violations, $8,400 in fines
- Mold in basement (visible): $15,000 remediation estimate
- Lead paint disclosure triggered: Encapsulation budget $4,000
- Galvanized plumbing: Full replacement $8,000
- Electrical update (knob and tube found): $12,000
- Cosmetic: $20,000
- Permit and inspection timeline: 4+ months
- **Total estimated repairs: $67,400**

**Deal analysis:**
- ARV from comps: $220,000
- Adjusted ARV (mold history): $220,000 × 0.95 = $209,000
- Buyer's maximum: (70% × $209,000) - $67,400 = $78,900
- Holding costs during permit process: $6,000
- Adjusted buyer maximum: $72,900
- Assignment fee target: $7,500
- Maximum offer: $65,400

**Deal structure used:** Subject-to the $45,000 remaining mortgage. Seller received $15,000 cash at closing for equity. Total effective purchase: $60,000. Assigned contract with mortgage assumption to investor for $70,000. Net profit: $5,000 cash + $5,000 assignment = $10,000 total.

### Example 3: Severe Fire Damage

**Property:** 2BR/1BA bungalow, 1940s construction
**Seller situation:** Fire 8 months ago, insurance dispute, seller exhausted
**Initial appearance:** Significant char damage, roof partially collapsed

**Your evaluation:**
- Structural: 60% of framing needs replacement, $45,000
- New roof (existing destroyed): $12,000
- All new systems (electric, plumbing, HVAC): $28,000
- Complete interior finish: $35,000
- Debris removal and demolition: $8,000
- **Total estimated repairs: $128,000**

**Deal analysis:**
- ARV from comps: $175,000
- Adjusted ARV (fire stigma): $175,000 × 0.90 = $157,500
- Buyer math: This is essentially new construction. Builders want 25%+ profit.
- Builder's maximum: $157,500 - $128,000 - $39,375 (25% profit) = -$9,875

**This deal doesn't work as traditional wholesale.**

**Alternative structure:** Negotiated with seller for $5,000 cash purchase (seller had zero equity after insurance settlement fell through). Partnered with builder on JV: Builder covers all costs, you contribute deal and project management. Projected completion value: $157,500. Builder's costs: $128,000 + $5,000 + $15,000 (hold/closing): $148,000. Profit split: $9,500 ÷ 2 = $4,750 each.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Underestimating hidden damage:** Assuming visible damage represents total damage. Water, fire, and structural issues always extend beyond what you can see. Add 20-30% contingency.

2. **Ignoring permit requirements:** Assuming repairs can be done without permits. Unpermitted work creates title and insurance issues. Always factor permit time and costs.

3. **Using standard ARV for stigmatized properties:** Calculating offers based on normal ARV when the property will carry stigma. Adjust ARV before calculating your offer.

4. **Skipping violation research:** Not pulling the complete code violation history. Hidden violations surface during buyer's due diligence and kill deals.

5. **Overlooking environmental hazards:** Failing to recognize asbestos, lead, or mold indicators. These can add $20,000+ to repair estimates and require licensed contractors.

6. **Underestimating hoarder cleanup:** Treating hoarder properties as simple cleanout jobs. Bio-hazard conditions, structural damage, and pest infestations hide beneath the surface.

7. **Forcing assignment structure on heavy distress:** Trying to assign contracts that require creative structures. Know when to use subject-to, seller financing, or JV arrangements.

8. **Trusting seller repair estimates:** Accepting seller's repair estimates or contractor quotes from years ago. Always perform independent evaluation.

9. **Missing financing implications:** Not recognizing that uninhabitable properties eliminate most buyer financing options, drastically shrinking your buyer pool.

10. **Ignoring holding costs during remediation:** Calculating repair costs without considering the 3-6 months of holding costs during permit processes and inspections.
