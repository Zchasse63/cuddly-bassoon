# Creative Deal Structures Beyond Standard Wholesale Assignments

## Quick Reference

- **Creative structures solve problems** that standard wholesale deals cannot address—motivated sellers with no equity, properties with below-market financing, or complex ownership situations
- **Subject-to deals** allow you to acquire properties while leaving the existing mortgage in place, preserving favorable loan terms
- **Seller financing** eliminates bank qualification requirements and creates flexible terms negotiated directly between parties
- **Novation agreements** replace the original purchase contract with a new one between the seller and your end buyer, often avoiding assignment restrictions
- **Wraparound mortgages** create new financing that "wraps around" existing debt, generating spread income
- **Lease-options** provide control without ownership, reducing capital requirements and risk exposure
- **Every creative structure carries unique legal requirements**—consult with a real estate attorney before implementing any of these strategies
- **Due-on-sale clauses** are a real risk in subject-to and wrap transactions; understand them before proceeding
- **Document everything meticulously**—creative deals require more paperwork, not less
- **Match the structure to the seller's problem**—the best creative deal is the one that solves their specific situation

## Understanding Creative Deal Structures

Standard wholesale transactions involve assigning a purchase contract to an end buyer for an assignment fee. While effective, this approach has limitations. Creative deal structures expand your toolkit, allowing you to capture opportunities that would otherwise slip away.

Creative financing becomes essential when sellers have little or no equity, when properties have existing financing worth preserving, when sellers need ongoing income rather than a lump sum, or when traditional wholesale margins don't exist.

## Subject-To Deals

### What Is a Subject-To?

A subject-to acquisition means purchasing a property "subject to" the existing mortgage remaining in place. You take title to the property while the seller's loan stays active. The seller remains liable for the mortgage on paper, but you control the property and make the payments.

### When Subject-To Makes Sense

Subject-to deals work best when:
- The existing loan has a below-market interest rate (common with loans originated before 2022)
- The seller has minimal equity but needs relief from payments
- The property cash flows with the existing debt structure
- Traditional financing would reduce returns or delay closing

### How to Structure Subject-To Deals

**Step 1: Verify the existing loan**
Request the seller's most recent mortgage statement. Confirm the balance, interest rate, monthly payment, and whether escrow is included.

**Step 2: Calculate the acquisition**
Purchase price should equal remaining loan balance plus any equity payment to the seller. If the loan balance is $180,000 and you're offering $5,000 cash for the seller's equity, your total acquisition cost is $185,000.

**Step 3: Document the transaction**
Use a subject-to purchase agreement that specifically states the existing financing will remain in place. Include authorization forms allowing you to communicate with the lender.

**Step 4: Close through title**
Record the deed transferring ownership to you (or your entity). Set up payment systems to ensure the mortgage is paid on time.

### Risk Considerations

The primary risk is the **due-on-sale clause**. Nearly all mortgages contain language allowing the lender to accelerate the loan (demand full payment) upon transfer of ownership. In practice, lenders rarely exercise this clause when payments are current, but the risk exists.

Mitigate this risk by:
- Maintaining perfect payment history
- Keeping insurance current
- Avoiding contact with the lender unless necessary
- Having an exit strategy if acceleration occurs

## Seller Financing Arrangements

### The Fundamentals

Seller financing means the seller acts as the bank. Instead of receiving all cash at closing, they receive payments over time. You provide a promissory note and secure it with a mortgage or deed of trust.

### Common Seller Financing Structures

**Full seller financing**: The seller finances the entire purchase price. Example: $150,000 property purchased with $10,000 down, seller carries $140,000 note at 6% over 20 years = $1,003/month payment.

**Partial seller financing**: Combine institutional financing with a seller second. Example: Bank finances 70% ($105,000), seller carries 20% ($30,000) as second position, buyer brings 10% ($15,000) down.

**Interest-only periods**: Negotiate interest-only payments initially to improve cash flow. Example: $140,000 note at 6% interest-only = $700/month vs. $1,003 fully amortized.

### When Sellers Accept Financing

Sellers agree to financing when:
- They want to defer capital gains taxes (installment sale treatment)
- They desire steady income in retirement
- The property won't sell conventionally
- They have no underlying mortgage to pay off
- Interest income exceeds alternative investments

### Structuring for Success

Always negotiate these terms:
- **Interest rate**: Market rates or below; 5-8% is common
- **Term length**: 5-30 years depending on strategy
- **Amortization vs. balloon**: Longer amortization with shorter balloon reduces payments while providing seller an exit
- **Prepayment penalties**: Avoid them or limit the window
- **Substitution of collateral**: Right to move the debt to another property

## Lease-Option Structures

### How Lease-Options Work

A lease-option combines a standard lease with an option to purchase. You gain control of the property without taking title, then assign or exercise the option for profit.

### Two-Part Documentation

**The lease**: Establishes your right to possess the property, monthly payment amount, lease term, and tenant responsibilities.

**The option**: Grants exclusive right (but not obligation) to purchase at a predetermined price within a specified timeframe. Typically requires non-refundable option consideration.

### The Sandwich Lease-Option

This strategy involves negotiating a lease-option with a seller, then finding a tenant-buyer who signs a separate lease-option with you at higher terms.

**Example**:
- Negotiate with seller: $1,200/month rent, $180,000 purchase price, 3-year option, $3,000 option consideration
- Find tenant-buyer: $1,500/month rent, $195,000 purchase price, 2-year option, $7,000 option consideration
- Your profit: $300/month cash flow ($10,800 over 3 years) + $4,000 option spread + $15,000 equity spread if exercised

### Risk Considerations

- If your tenant-buyer defaults, you're still obligated on the master lease
- Option periods can expire before finding a buyer
- Some states heavily regulate lease-options—California, Texas, and others have specific requirements
- Failure to exercise means losing option consideration

## Novation Agreements

### What Is Novation?

Novation replaces an existing contract with a new one, substituting a new party for an original party. In wholesaling, this means replacing yourself with your end buyer as the purchaser directly with the seller.

### Why Use Novation?

Novation solves several problems:
- Properties listed on MLS where assignment is prohibited
- Sellers who don't want assignments
- End buyers who want direct contracts with sellers
- Transactions requiring lender approval that won't allow assignments

### The Novation Process

**Step 1**: Sign purchase agreement with seller (you as buyer)

**Step 2**: Find end buyer and negotiate your fee

**Step 3**: Execute novation agreement with all three parties—seller releases you, end buyer assumes your position, and you receive your fee

**Step 4**: New buyer closes directly with seller

### Documentation Requirements

A proper novation requires:
- Written consent from all original parties
- Clear release of the original buyer's obligations
- Assumption of all terms by the new buyer
- Consideration (your fee structure)
- All required disclosures

## Land Contracts / Contract for Deed

### Structure Overview

A land contract (also called contract for deed, installment land contract, or agreement for deed) keeps title with the seller while the buyer makes payments. Title transfers only when the contract is paid in full or conditions are met.

### Key Components

- **Purchase price and payment terms**: Total price, down payment, monthly amount, interest rate
- **Title retention**: Seller keeps deed until conditions satisfied
- **Forfeiture provisions**: What happens if buyer defaults
- **Recording**: Contract should be recorded to protect buyer's interest
- **Responsibilities**: Who pays taxes, insurance, and maintenance

### Wholesaling Land Contract Opportunities

You can wholesale your interest in a land contract or help sellers structure land contracts with buyers. Some investors specifically seek properties with existing land contracts.

**Example**: Seller has property worth $120,000. You negotiate a land contract purchase: $5,000 down, $100,000 total price, 6% interest, $800/month. After six months of payments ($4,800 paid, roughly $3,200 to principal), you assign your interest for $15,000. Your net profit after down payment: approximately $7,000.

### Legal Considerations

Land contracts face heavy regulation in many states:
- Ohio requires specific notice provisions and cure periods
- Michigan has strict forfeiture procedures
- Some states treat long-term land contracts as mortgages, requiring foreclosure rather than forfeiture
- Recording protects the buyer but also creates title issues if the contract fails

## Wraparound Mortgages

### How Wraps Work

A wraparound mortgage creates new financing that "wraps around" existing debt. The wrap note includes the underlying mortgage balance plus any additional amount financed. The wrap holder collects payments on the full amount and makes payments on the underlying debt, keeping the spread.

### The Numbers

**Example**:
- Property value: $200,000
- Existing mortgage: $120,000 at 4% ($573/month)
- Wrap mortgage: $180,000 at 7% ($1,198/month on 30-year amortization)
- Spread income: $625/month

Your buyer pays you $1,198. You pay the underlying lender $573. You keep $625 monthly plus you're earning 7% on $60,000 of new money while the underlying debt amortizes at 4%.

### Risks and Safeguards

Wraps carry significant risks:
- Due-on-sale clause enforcement
- Wrap buyer default leaves you responsible for underlying mortgage
- Underlying mortgage payment misapplication
- Complex accounting and tax implications

Protect yourself by:
- Using third-party payment servicing
- Requiring substantial down payments
- Maintaining reserves for underlying payments
- Including strong default provisions

## Partial Interest Acquisitions

### Buying Fractional Interests

When multiple parties own a property, you can purchase one owner's share rather than the entire property. This works with:
- Inherited properties with multiple heirs
- Partnership dissolutions
- Divorce situations
- Feuding co-owners

### Partition Rights

Owning a partial interest grants partition rights—the legal ability to force a sale or physical division of the property. This provides leverage even with a minority interest.

### Strategy Example

Three siblings inherit a property worth $300,000 with no mortgage. Two want to sell; one doesn't. You offer the motivated sibling $70,000 for their 33% interest (a discount to the $100,000 proportional value). You now own a partial interest and can negotiate with remaining owners or file partition action to force sale.

## Joint Venture Structures

### JV in Wholesaling

Joint ventures allow you to partner with others who have resources you lack—capital, experience, buyer lists, or deal flow.

### Common JV Arrangements

**Capital partner + deal finder**: You find deals, partner provides earnest money and funds marketing. Split assignment fees 50/50.

**Experienced/novice partnership**: Experienced wholesaler provides mentorship, contracts, and buyer list. Novice brings hustle and deal flow. Split 60/40 favoring experience initially.

**Market expansion JV**: Established wholesaler in one market partners with local expert in new market. Local partner handles acquisitions; established partner provides systems and capital.

### Structuring JV Agreements

Document every joint venture with:
- Specific roles and responsibilities
- Capital contribution requirements
- Profit split formula
- Decision-making authority
- Dispute resolution process
- Exit provisions

## Hybrid Deal Structures

### Combining Strategies

Real-world deals often combine multiple structures. Common hybrids include:

**Subject-to with seller carryback**: Take property subject-to existing $150,000 first mortgage, seller carries $20,000 second for their equity, you bring nothing to closing.

**Lease-option to subject-to**: Control property with lease-option, convert to subject-to acquisition when exercising option.

**Wrap with land contract**: Acquire via land contract, sell on wrap to your buyer, creating two levels of financing.

### Matching Structure to Situation

| Seller Situation | Recommended Structure |
|------------------|----------------------|
| No equity, needs payment relief | Subject-to |
| Free and clear, wants income | Seller financing |
| Can't sell, needs time | Lease-option |
| Multiple owners disagreeing | Partial interest |
| Good loan, some equity | Hybrid subject-to + seller second |

## Legal Requirements and Disclosures

### Universal Requirements

All creative structures require:
- Written agreements signed by all parties
- Proper notarization where required
- Recording of documents affecting title
- Compliance with state-specific regulations
- Clear disclosure of material terms

### State-Specific Concerns

Creative financing faces varying regulation:
- Texas TREC contracts have specific seller financing provisions
- Dodd-Frank safe harbors affect seller financing terms
- Some states require licensing for certain structures
- Recording requirements vary significantly

### Disclosure Obligations

Always disclose:
- Your role and profit in the transaction
- Any existing financing remaining in place
- Due-on-sale clause risks
- The nature of the buyer's interest (equitable vs. legal title)

## Examples

### Example 1: Subject-To Acquisition

**Situation**: Seller owes $185,000 on a home worth $210,000. They're three months behind on payments and facing foreclosure. Loan is at 3.5% interest ($830/month P&I).

**Solution**: Acquire subject-to for $190,000 total (loan balance plus $5,000 cash to seller for moving). Bring payments current ($2,490). Sell on lease-option for $230,000 with $10,000 option fee and $1,400/month rent.

**Numbers**:
- Acquisition: $5,000 + $2,490 arrears = $7,490
- Monthly spread: $1,400 - $830 = $570
- Option fee: $10,000
- Backend profit if exercised: $40,000

### Example 2: Seller Financing to Wholesale

**Situation**: Free-and-clear property worth $180,000. Seller is retired, wants steady income, and won't discount for cash.

**Solution**: Offer $175,000 with $10,000 down, seller carries $165,000 at 5.5% interest-only for 5 years, balloon at end. Assign the contract to investor for $18,000 assignment fee.

**Investor benefit**: Acquires cash-flowing asset with only $28,000 out of pocket ($10,000 down + $18,000 fee), payment of $756/month on property worth $180,000.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Ignoring due-on-sale risk**: Assuming lenders will never call the loan is dangerous. Always have contingency capital.

2. **Inadequate documentation**: Creative deals need more paperwork, not less. Verbal agreements lead to lawsuits.

3. **Failing to verify existing loan terms**: Always get current payoff statements and verify loan details before committing.

4. **Underestimating insurance complications**: Subject-to and wrap deals create insurance issues. The named insured must match the policy structure.

5. **Neglecting servicing obligations**: Collecting wrap payments and making underlying payments requires systems. Missing one payment can trigger default.

6. **Not consulting attorneys**: Each state has different rules. A $500 attorney consultation prevents $50,000 mistakes.

7. **Over-leveraging**: Creative structures can stack multiple layers of financing. Don't create houses of cards.

8. **Ignoring seller's ongoing liability**: In subject-to deals, sellers remain liable. Disclose this clearly and maintain communication.

9. **Forgetting exit strategy**: Every creative deal needs multiple exit paths. What if your buyer defaults? What if the market changes?

10. **Treating all sellers the same**: Creative financing requires understanding each seller's unique situation and motivation.
