# Complete Deal Analysis Framework for Real Estate Wholesaling

## Quick Reference

- **The MAO Formula**: Maximum Allowable Offer = ARV × 70% - Repair Costs - Wholesale Fee
- **Minimum wholesale fee**: $5,000 for low-value properties, $10,000-$15,000 standard, scale up for higher-value deals
- **Quick screening time**: 2 minutes or less using the "napkin math" method before investing deeper analysis
- **The 70% rule** leaves room for all costs plus profit—never exceed it without documented justification
- **ARV accuracy** is the single most important factor—everything else cascades from this number
- **Holding costs** typically run 1-2% of purchase price per month for flippers
- **Closing costs** average 2-3% for the buy side and 6-8% for the sell side
- **Kill the deal fast** if numbers don't work—your time is your most valuable asset
- **Deep dive analysis** only happens after a deal passes initial screening and shows profit potential
- **Document everything**—your analysis becomes your negotiation tool and buyer presentation

## The Complete Deal Analysis Workflow

### Phase 1: Lead Intake and Initial Data Capture

When a lead comes in—whether from direct mail, cold calling, driving for dollars, or any other channel—you need to capture specific information immediately:

**Essential Data Points:**
- Property address and type (single-family, duplex, etc.)
- Owner's asking price or motivation level
- Property condition (owner's description)
- Why they're selling (motivation indicator)
- Timeline for selling
- Mortgage balance (if they'll share)

This information takes 30-60 seconds to gather during an initial conversation or from your lead source. Don't proceed to analysis without at least the address, condition estimate, and some sense of motivation.

### Phase 2: Quick Screening (The 2-Minute Filter)

Before investing serious time into any deal, run it through rapid screening. You should be able to determine "worth pursuing" or "dead deal" within two minutes.

**Step 1: Instant ARV Estimate (45 seconds)**
Pull up Zillow, Redfin, or your MLS access. Look at the Zestimate and recent sales in the immediate area. For a rough ARV:
- Check the subject property's estimated value
- Scan 3-4 nearby recent sales of similar size
- Establish a rough range (example: $180,000-$210,000)

**Step 2: Condition-Based Repair Estimate (30 seconds)**
Use broad categories for initial screening:

| Condition Level | Repair Estimate |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Cosmetic only (paint, carpet, cleaning) | $10,000-$20,000 |
| Light rehab (cosmetic + minor updates) | $20,000-$35,000 |
| Medium rehab (kitchen, baths, systems work) | $35,000-$60,000 |
| Heavy rehab (down to studs, structural) | $60,000-$100,000+ |

**Step 3: Quick MAO Calculation (30 seconds)**
Apply the standard formula:
```
Quick MAO = ARV × 70% - Repairs - Your Fee
```

Example: ARV of $200,000, medium rehab condition
- $200,000 × 0.70 = $140,000
- $140,000 - $45,000 (repairs) = $95,000
- $95,000 - $10,000 (your fee) = $85,000 MAO

**Step 4: Compare to Seller Expectations (15 seconds)**
If the seller wants $120,000 and your MAO is $85,000, you have a $35,000 gap. That's likely a dead deal unless motivation increases or you discover the ARV is higher.

If the seller wants $80,000, you have a potential deal worth deeper analysis.

### Phase 3: Qualification Questions

Before committing to deep analysis, verify these deal qualifiers:

**Motivation Check:**
- Is there a genuine reason to sell quickly?
- Are they facing foreclosure, divorce, inheritance, relocation, or financial distress?
- Have they already tried listing with an agent?

**Timeline Check:**
- Do they need to close in the next 30-60 days?
- Is there urgency, or are they "just testing the market"?

**Equity Check:**
- What do they owe on the property?
- Is there enough equity to make the numbers work?
- Are there other liens or judgments?

If motivation, timeline, and equity align, proceed to deep analysis.

### Phase 4: Deep Dive Analysis

This is where you invest 30-60 minutes to thoroughly analyze a qualified lead.

**Step 1: Accurate ARV Determination**

Pull 3-6 comparable sales meeting these criteria:
- Sold within the last 90 days (180 days maximum in slow markets)
- Within 0.5 miles (1 mile maximum in rural areas)
- Similar square footage (within 15-20%)
- Similar bedroom/bathroom count
- Similar lot size
- Similar age and construction style

Adjust each comp for differences:
- Add $20-40 per square foot if subject is larger
- Subtract $20-40 per square foot if subject is smaller
- Add/subtract $3,000-$8,000 per bedroom difference
- Add/subtract $5,000-$10,000 per bathroom difference
- Adjust for garage, pool, basement, lot size differences

Calculate your ARV as the adjusted average of your best 3 comps.

**Step 2: Detailed Repair Estimation**

Break down repairs by category:

| Category | Typical Costs |
|----------|--------------|
| Roof (full replacement) | $6,000-$15,000 |
| HVAC (new system) | $4,000-$8,000 |
| Kitchen (mid-grade update) | $15,000-$30,000 |
| Bathroom (per bath) | $5,000-$12,000 |
| Flooring (per sq ft) | $3-$8 installed |
| Paint (interior, full house) | $3,000-$6,000 |
| Electrical (panel + updates) | $3,000-$8,000 |
| Plumbing (repiping) | $4,000-$10,000 |
| Foundation repairs | $5,000-$20,000+ |
| Windows (per window) | $300-$600 |

For best accuracy, walk the property with a contractor or use a detailed scope of work checklist.

**Step 3: Calculate All Costs**

**Holding Costs (for your buyer):**
- Mortgage interest: Purchase price × interest rate ÷ 12 × months
- Property taxes: Annual amount ÷ 12 × months
- Insurance: Typically $100-$200/month
- Utilities: $150-$300/month
- Lawn/maintenance: $100-$200/month

Average holding period for flips: 4-6 months
Total holding costs typically equal 1-2% of purchase price per month.

**Closing Costs:**
- Buy-side costs: 2-3% of purchase price (title, recording, etc.)
- Sell-side costs: 6-8% of ARV (agent commissions, title, transfer taxes)
- Your assignment fee creates no additional closing costs

**Step 4: Final MAO Calculation**

Use the complete formula:
```
MAO = ARV - Repairs - Holding Costs - Buy Closing - Sell Closing - Flipper Profit - Your Fee
```

Or use the industry-standard simplified version:
```
MAO = ARV × 70% - Repairs - Your Fee
```

The 70% rule accounts for approximately:
- 10% for holding costs and closing costs combined
- 20% for flipper profit margin

### Phase 5: Offer Preparation and Submission

Once you've calculated your MAO, prepare your offer strategy:

**Offer Positioning:**
- Start at 80-85% of your MAO (leaves negotiation room)
- Know your walkaway number before making the call
- Present value beyond just price (speed, certainty, convenience)

## Key Metrics Explained

### After Repair Value (ARV)

ARV represents what the property will sell for after complete renovation to market standards. This is the foundation of every calculation.

**What affects ARV:**
- Location and neighborhood desirability
- School district ratings
- Comparable recent sales
- Current market conditions (appreciating vs. declining)
- Renovation quality level (investor grade vs. retail grade)

**ARV accuracy requirement:** Within 5% of actual sale price. A $10,000 error on a $200,000 ARV can eliminate all profit.

### Repair Costs

Repair costs encompass all renovation expenses required to bring the property to ARV condition.

**Include in repair estimates:**
- Materials and labor
- Permit fees
- Contractor profit margins
- Contingency (10-15% of total estimate)
- Dumpster and cleanup costs

**Common repair categories:**
- Structural and foundation
- Roofing and exterior
- HVAC, electrical, plumbing
- Kitchen and bathrooms
- Flooring and paint
- Landscaping and curb appeal

### Holding Costs

Holding costs are expenses incurred while the property is owned but not producing income.

**Monthly holding cost components:**
- Hard money loan payments (12-15% annually)
- Property taxes (varies by location)
- Property insurance
- Utilities
- Property maintenance
- HOA fees (if applicable)

**Rule of thumb:** Budget 1.5% of purchase price per month for holding costs.

### Closing Costs

Closing costs occur at both the purchase and sale of the property.

**Buy-side (2-3% of purchase price):**
- Title search and insurance
- Recording fees
- Attorney fees (in attorney states)
- Loan origination fees

**Sell-side (6-8% of ARV):**
- Real estate agent commissions (5-6%)
- Title insurance (seller's policy)
- Transfer taxes and recording
- Prorated taxes and HOA

### Wholesale Fee

Your assignment fee is the profit you make for finding and contracting the deal.

**Typical wholesale fees:**
- $5,000-$8,000: Lower-priced properties under $100,000
- $10,000-$15,000: Standard deals $100,000-$250,000
- $15,000-$25,000: Higher-value properties $250,000-$500,000
- $25,000+: Premium properties or exceptional deals

**Your fee should be 5-10% of the spread between your contract price and end buyer's purchase price.**

### Flipper Profit

Your end buyer needs to profit for the deal to close. Investors typically require:

**Minimum profit requirements:**
- 15-20% of ARV for experienced flippers
- 20-25% of ARV for newer investors
- Higher margins in uncertain markets
- Lower margins acceptable in hot markets

## Minimum Acceptable Margins by Deal Type

### Standard Single-Family Flip
- **Use:** 70% rule
- **Minimum wholesale fee:** $10,000
- **Minimum buyer profit:** 15% of ARV

### High-End Properties (ARV $400,000+)
- **Use:** 75% rule (higher price tolerance)
- **Minimum wholesale fee:** $20,000-$30,000
- **Minimum buyer profit:** 12-15% of ARV

### Low-End Properties (ARV under $100,000)
- **Use:** 65% rule (tighter margins required)
- **Minimum wholesale fee:** $5,000
- **Minimum buyer profit:** 20% of ARV

### Buy-and-Hold Rental Properties
- **Different calculation:** Focus on cash-on-cash return
- **Target:** 8-12% cash-on-cash return for buyers
- **Apply:** 75-80% of ARV minus repairs (lower profit requirement)

### Properties Needing Major Work
- **Use:** 65% rule or lower
- **Higher repair contingency:** 20% buffer
- **Minimum wholesale fee:** $8,000-$12,000

## Examples

### Example 1: Standard Single-Family Flip

**Property:** 3BR/2BA ranch, 1,400 sq ft, built 1985
**Location:** Suburban neighborhood, good schools
**Condition:** Outdated kitchen/baths, needs new HVAC, cosmetic updates throughout

**Quick Screen (2 minutes):**
- Zillow estimate: $245,000
- Recent sales nearby: $235,000-$260,000
- Estimated ARV: $250,000
- Condition: Medium rehab = $45,000 estimate
- Quick MAO: $250,000 × 70% - $45,000 - $12,000 = $118,000
- Seller asking: $125,000

**Decision:** Only $7,000 over MAO. Worth negotiating. Proceed to deep analysis.

**Deep Dive Results:**
- Verified ARV (4 comps): $252,000
- Contractor repair estimate: $48,000
- Final MAO: $252,000 × 70% - $48,000 - $12,000 = $116,400

**Offer:** $110,000 initial, willing to go to $116,000
**Negotiated price:** $115,000

**Buyer sale price:** $127,000
**Your assignment fee:** $12,000
**Buyer's expected profit:** $252,000 - $127,000 - $48,000 - $38,000 (holding/closing) = $39,000 (15.5% of ARV)

### Example 2: Deal That Doesn't Work

**Property:** 4BR/2.5BA two-story, 2,200 sq ft, built 2005
**Location:** Nice subdivision
**Condition:** Minor cosmetic updates only

**Quick Screen:**
- Estimated ARV: $340,000
- Repairs: Cosmetic = $18,000
- Quick MAO: $340,000 × 70% - $18,000 - $15,000 = $205,000
- Seller wants: $290,000
- Mortgage balance: $265,000

**Decision:** $85,000 gap between MAO and seller's price. Seller has minimal equity and unrealistic expectations. Pass immediately.

**Why this doesn't work:** Even at mortgage balance ($265,000), the deal doesn't pencil:
- ARV: $340,000
- Purchase at $265,000 = 78% of ARV
- Only $57,000 left for repairs, holding costs, closing costs, AND profit
- No room for wholesale fee
- Pass and move on

### Example 3: Low-Value Property Analysis

**Property:** 2BR/1BA, 900 sq ft, built 1955
**Location:** Working-class neighborhood
**Condition:** Heavy rehab needed

**Quick Screen:**
- Estimated ARV: $85,000
- Repairs: Heavy = $35,000
- Quick MAO (65% rule for low-end): $85,000 × 65% - $35,000 - $6,000 = $14,250
- Seller wants: $15,000 (inherited, vacant)

**Decision:** Close to MAO with motivated seller. Worth deep analysis.

**Deep Dive Results:**
- Verified ARV: $82,000
- Detailed repairs: $38,000
- Final MAO: $82,000 × 65% - $38,000 - $6,000 = $9,300

**Offer:** $8,500
**Seller accepts:** $9,000 (motivated to sell quickly)

**Buyer sale:** $15,000 (buyer accepts lower margins on rental play)
**Your fee:** $6,000

### Example 4: High-Value Property

**Property:** 5BR/4BA, 3,800 sq ft, built 1998
**Location:** Upscale neighborhood
**Condition:** Dated but well-maintained

**Quick Screen:**
- Estimated ARV: $625,000
- Repairs: Medium-light = $55,000
- Quick MAO (75% rule): $625,000 × 75% - $55,000 - $25,000 = $388,750
- Seller wants: $400,000 (divorce, needs quick sale)

**Decision:** Close margins but motivated seller and high-value deal. Proceed carefully.

**Deep Dive Results:**
- Verified ARV: $615,000
- Repairs: $62,000
- Final MAO: $615,000 × 75% - $62,000 - $25,000 = $374,250

**Negotiation:** Present data showing $375,000 is maximum. Seller accepts $380,000 with quick close.

**Stretch decision:** Accept at $380,000 (slightly over MAO) because:
- Strong buyer demand in this price range
- Lower fee acceptable ($20,000 vs. $25,000)
- Quick close saves seller significant carrying costs

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Overestimating ARV
**The mistake:** Using the highest comp or Zillow estimates without adjustments.
**The impact:** Every $10,000 ARV error directly reduces your buyer's profit and deal viability.
**The fix:** Always use 3-6 comps, make proper adjustments, and be conservative. When in doubt, use the lower number.

### 2. Underestimating Repairs
**The mistake:** Missing major systems, forgetting permits, or using contractor-level pricing when investors use higher-margin contractors.
**The impact:** Blown budgets kill deals and damage your reputation with buyers.
**The fix:** Add 15-20% contingency to all repair estimates. Walk properties whenever possible.

### 3. Ignoring Holding Costs
**The mistake:** Calculating MAO without accounting for 4-6 months of carrying costs.
**The impact:** $1,500/month holding costs over 5 months = $7,500 eaten from profit.
**The fix:** The 70% rule accounts for this, but verify for longer rehabs or expensive properties.

### 4. Wholesale Fee Too Small
**The mistake:** Accepting $3,000-$5,000 fees on deals that required significant work to find and close.
**The impact:** Unsustainable business model and undervalued skills.
**The fix:** Set minimum fee standards and don't deviate. Your time has value.

### 5. Emotional Attachment to Deals
**The mistake:** Trying to force deals that don't work because you've invested time.
**The impact:** Bad deals damage reputation and may not close.
**The fix:** Kill deals fast. The next good deal is one phone call away.

### 6. Using Outdated Comparable Sales
**The mistake:** Using sales from 6+ months ago in changing markets.
**The impact:** ARV could be significantly different in appreciating or declining markets.
**The fix:** Prioritize sales within 90 days. Adjust for market trends when using older data.

### 7. Skipping Title Research
**The mistake:** Not checking for liens, judgments, or title issues before going under contract.
**The impact:** Deals fall apart at closing or require significant price reductions.
**The fix:** Run preliminary title searches early in the process.

### 8. Not Understanding Your Buyer's Requirements
**The mistake:** Calculating numbers without knowing what your buyers actually need.
**The impact:** Deals that look good on paper don't sell to your buyer list.
**The fix:** Know your buyers' profit requirements, preferred property types, and risk tolerance.

### 9. Applying One Formula to All Markets
**The mistake:** Using 70% rule universally regardless of market conditions.
**The impact:** Missing deals in hot markets or overpaying in buyer's markets.
**The fix:** Adjust percentages based on local market dynamics and buyer feedback.

### 10. Analysis Paralysis
**The mistake:** Spending hours analyzing deals that should be killed in 2 minutes.
**The impact:** Wasted time better spent finding viable deals.
**The fix:** Trust the quick screening process. Most leads aren't deals—find that out fast.
