# Understanding Title and Liens in Wholesale Real Estate Deals

## Quick Reference

- **Clean title** means the property has clear, uncontested ownership with no undisclosed liens or claims that would prevent transfer
- **Lien priority** follows the "first in time, first in right" rule—whoever records first gets paid first at closing
- **Tax liens** almost always take priority over all other liens, including mortgages
- A standard **title search** costs $75-$200 and takes 24-72 hours; order one before assigning any contract
- **Title insurance** protects against undiscovered defects and typically costs 0.5%-1% of the purchase price
- Common deal-killers include unreleased liens, boundary disputes, probate issues, and missing heirs
- Check **county recorder websites** and public records before making offers to identify obvious title issues
- **Probate properties** require court approval and additional time—factor 60-180 days for closing
- **Divorce situations** require both spouses' signatures regardless of whose name is on the deed
- Most title issues can be resolved with time, money, or both—knowing the cost helps you negotiate better

## What Is "Clean Title" and Why It Matters

Clean title—also called clear title or marketable title—means a property has unambiguous, legally defensible ownership with no outstanding claims, liens, encumbrances, or defects that would prevent a smooth transfer to a new owner.

Think of title like the chain of custody for evidence. Every time a property changes hands, that transfer must be properly documented and recorded. If there's a break in that chain—a missing signature, an unreleased lien, a forged deed—the title is compromised.

For wholesalers, clean title is everything. Your buyer is paying an assignment fee based on the assumption they can actually take ownership of the property. If title issues surface after you've collected your fee, you face potential lawsuits, refund demands, and reputation damage that can end your business.

Here's the reality: approximately 25-30% of all real estate transactions encounter some form of title issue. Most are minor and easily resolved, but roughly 5-8% have serious problems that delay or kill deals. As a wholesaler, you need to identify these issues before committing to a contract—or at minimum, before assigning it to a buyer.

## Types of Liens You'll Encounter

### Mortgage Liens (First Position Debt)
The primary mortgage is typically the largest lien on a property. When a homeowner finances their purchase, the lender records a mortgage lien (or deed of trust in some states) that gives them the right to foreclose if payments stop.

**What to know:** Mortgage balances don't appear on public record—you'll see the original loan amount, but not the current payoff. A property with a $200,000 original mortgage recorded in 2015 might have a current balance anywhere from $175,000 to $195,000 depending on the loan terms and payment history.

### HELOC and Second Mortgages
Home equity lines of credit and second mortgages are junior liens that sit behind the first mortgage. These create complications because sellers often forget about them or underestimate the balance.

**What to know:** HELOCs are revolving credit—a $100,000 HELOC might have a $10,000 balance or a $95,000 balance. The only way to know is getting a payoff statement directly from the lender. Always ask sellers: "Do you have any other loans against the property besides your main mortgage?"

### Property Tax Liens
When property taxes go unpaid, local governments place tax liens that take **super-priority** over almost all other liens, including first mortgages. This means tax liens get paid first at closing, regardless of when they were recorded.

**What to know:** In most jurisdictions, property tax liens can lead to tax foreclosure sales after 1-3 years of delinquency. Check the county treasurer's website for tax payment status on any property you're evaluating.

### Mechanic's Liens (Contractor Liens)
When contractors, subcontractors, or material suppliers aren't paid for work performed on a property, they can file mechanic's liens. These liens "relate back" to when the work began, which can affect their priority position.

**What to know:** Mechanic's liens are common on properties with incomplete renovations—a major red flag in distressed properties. The lien amount might be $5,000 for unpaid plumbing work or $50,000+ for a general contractor dispute.

### Judgment Liens
When someone wins a lawsuit and receives a monetary judgment, they can record that judgment as a lien against the debtor's real property. These attach to all real estate the debtor owns in that county.

**What to know:** Judgment liens often surprise sellers. Someone who lost a lawsuit five years ago might not realize that judgment is now attached to their home. Common sources include credit card judgments, personal injury awards, and breach of contract cases.

### IRS and State Tax Liens
The IRS and state tax agencies can place liens for unpaid income taxes, payroll taxes, or other tax obligations. Federal tax liens attach to all property owned by the taxpayer and are particularly serious.

**What to know:** IRS liens have a 10-year statute of limitations but can be renewed. The IRS must be notified of any property sale and may have redemption rights even after the sale closes. State tax liens vary by jurisdiction but follow similar patterns.

### HOA Liens
Homeowners association dues, special assessments, and fines can become liens if unpaid. In some states, HOA liens have super-priority status that can surpass even first mortgages (up to a certain amount).

**What to know:** HOA liens are common in condo and townhouse deals. Delinquent dues of $2,000-$3,000 can snowball to $10,000+ with fines, interest, and legal fees. Always contact the HOA directly for a complete statement of account.

## Lien Priority and How It Affects Payoff

Understanding lien priority determines how much equity—if any—actually exists in a property.

### The Priority Hierarchy

1. **Property taxes** (super-priority in almost all states)
2. **Special assessments** (sewer, water, municipal improvements)
3. **HOA liens** (super-priority portion in some states, typically 6-12 months of dues)
4. **First mortgage** (first recorded mortgage lien)
5. **Second mortgage/HELOC** (second recorded mortgage lien)
6. **Mechanic's liens** (priority based on work commencement date)
7. **Judgment liens** (in order of recording)
8. **IRS liens** (in order of recording, though IRS has special rules)

### How Priority Affects Your Deals

At closing, liens are paid in priority order. If there isn't enough money from the sale to pay all liens, junior lienholders may not get paid—and they may not agree to release their liens.

**Example scenario:** A property has:
- $8,000 in back property taxes (priority 1)
- $195,000 first mortgage balance (priority 2)
- $35,000 HELOC balance (priority 3)
- $12,000 judgment lien (priority 4)
- **Total liens: $250,000**

If you contract the property at $230,000, you're $20,000 short of paying all liens. The judgment lienholder definitely won't release, and the HELOC holder might not either. This deal can't close unless:
- The seller brings $20,000 to closing
- You negotiate lien reductions with creditors
- You abandon the deal

## Title Search Process and Costs

### What a Title Search Reveals

A professional title search examines public records to discover:
- Current ownership and how title is held (sole, joint, trust, etc.)
- Chain of title for the past 40-60 years
- Recorded liens, mortgages, and encumbrances
- Easements and restrictions
- Recorded judgments against the owner
- Tax payment status
- Pending legal actions (lis pendens)

### Types of Title Searches

**Full title search:** Comprehensive examination of all records, required for title insurance. Cost: $150-$400 depending on location and complexity.

**Current owner search:** Examines only the current owner's period of ownership. Cost: $75-$200. Suitable for preliminary due diligence.

**Two-owner search:** Covers current and previous owner. Cost: $100-$250. Good balance of depth and cost.

### Timeline and Process

1. **Order the search** through a title company, attorney, or title abstract company
2. **Examiner pulls records** from county recorder, tax assessor, and court systems
3. **Preliminary report generated** showing findings
4. **Review and address** any issues discovered
5. **Final title commitment** issued when issues are resolved

Standard turnaround: 24-72 hours for residential properties. Complex properties with long history or multiple issues may take 5-10 business days.

### Pro Tip for Wholesalers

Build relationships with 2-3 title companies. Many will run a "quick search" or "preliminary title check" for free or reduced cost if you bring them closing business. This preliminary check can catch major issues before you spend money on a full search.

## Title Insurance: What It Covers

Title insurance protects against losses from defects that existed before the policy date but weren't discovered during the title search.

### Two Types of Policies

**Lender's policy (loan policy):** Protects the mortgage lender. Required by virtually all lenders. Coverage equals the loan amount and decreases as the loan is paid down.

**Owner's policy:** Protects the property buyer. Optional but highly recommended. Coverage equals the purchase price and remains constant.

### What Title Insurance Covers

- Forged deeds, releases, or other documents
- Undisclosed heirs or missing heirs
- Errors in public records
- Unknown liens or encumbrances
- Fraudulent impersonation of property owners
- Defective acknowledgments or notarizations
- Mistakes in examining records
- Undisclosed but recorded easements or restrictions

### What Title Insurance Doesn't Cover

- Known defects (those disclosed before policy issuance)
- Government actions (zoning, building codes)
- Native American claims
- Environmental issues
- Defects created after policy date
- Items specifically excluded in the policy

### Typical Costs

Title insurance is a one-time premium paid at closing:
- **Owner's policy:** 0.5%-1% of purchase price
- **Lender's policy:** 0.3%-0.5% of loan amount

On a $200,000 purchase: approximately $1,000-$2,000 for owner's policy.

## Common Title Defects That Kill Deals

### Unreleased Liens
The most common issue. A mortgage or lien that was paid off but never properly released of record. The original lender must provide a release document, which can be difficult if the lender has been acquired, merged, or gone out of business.

**Resolution:** Track down the successor company or obtain a lost release affidavit. Timeline: 2-6 weeks.

### Missing Heirs
When a property owner dies, all heirs have potential ownership claims. If one heir can't be located or refuses to sign, the title is clouded.

**Resolution:** Extensive skip tracing, quiet title action, or negotiation with holdout heirs. Timeline: 1-12 months.

### Boundary and Survey Disputes
Fences, driveways, or structures that encroach on neighboring property create title issues. Buyers want to know exactly what they're purchasing.

**Resolution:** New survey, neighbor agreements, or adjustment of sale price. Timeline: 1-4 weeks for survey.

### Forged or Fraudulent Documents
Though rare, forged deeds and fraudulent transfers do occur, especially in properties that have changed hands multiple times or involve elderly owners.

**Resolution:** Usually requires title insurance claim or legal action. Timeline: 6-24 months.

### Improper Vesting
Title transferred to "John Smith" but the person is actually "John J. Smith Jr." or title taken in an individual name when it should have been in a trust or LLC.

**Resolution:** Corrective deed to fix the vesting. Timeline: 1-2 weeks.

## How to Identify Potential Title Issues Before Making Offers

Smart wholesalers screen for title issues before committing to a property:

### Online Public Records Check
Most counties have online access to:
- Property tax records (check payment status)
- Recorded documents (deeds, mortgages, liens)
- Court records (judgments, lis pendens)

Spend 15-20 minutes checking these resources before every offer.

### Red Flag Questions to Ask Sellers

1. "How did you acquire this property?" (inheritance, divorce, regular purchase)
2. "Is anyone else on the title besides you?"
3. "Are there any other loans against the property?"
4. "Are the property taxes current?"
5. "Have you had any lawsuits or judgments against you?"
6. "Have you done any work on the property that hasn't been paid for?"

### Warning Signs During Property Visits

- Incomplete construction or renovation work
- Property in deceased person's name (probate likely needed)
- Mail addressed to multiple people
- HOA community with visible signs of deferred maintenance
- Multiple "for sale by owner" signs over time (previous deals may have failed)

## Dealing with Probate and Estate Properties

### What Probate Means for Wholesalers

When a property owner dies, their estate typically goes through probate—a court-supervised process to settle debts and distribute assets. Probate properties can be excellent wholesale opportunities but require additional knowledge.

### Timeline Expectations

- **Simple probate (will exists, uncontested):** 4-8 months
- **Complex probate (no will, disputes, or creditor claims):** 12-24 months
- **Summary probate (small estates):** 30-60 days in some states

### Key Players

- **Executor/Personal Representative:** Person authorized to act on behalf of the estate
- **Probate Attorney:** Manages the legal process
- **Probate Court:** Approves major decisions including real estate sales

### Structuring Probate Deals

1. Verify the executor has **Letters Testamentary** or **Letters of Administration**
2. Confirm whether the sale requires **court confirmation** (varies by state and estate type)
3. Build extra time into your contract—60-90 days minimum
4. Include contingencies for court approval if required
5. Consider working with the probate attorney to ensure proper procedures

### Probate Property Pricing

Probate sales often require independent appraisals. In states with court confirmation, the property may be subject to overbidding at a court hearing. Factor this uncertainty into your offers and buyer negotiations.

## Divorce Situations and Title

### The Signature Problem

In most states, both spouses have legal rights to the marital home, regardless of whose name appears on the deed. This means you need **both signatures** on your purchase contract and closing documents—even if the divorce is final.

### Common Divorce Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Divorce is final, quitclaim executed**
One spouse was awarded the property and the other signed a quitclaim deed. Cleanest situation—verify the quitclaim was recorded.

**Scenario 2: Divorce is final, no quitclaim**
The decree says one spouse gets the house, but no deed was ever executed. The non-owning spouse must sign a quitclaim deed before closing.

**Scenario 3: Divorce is pending**
Both spouses must agree to the sale. The divorce attorney and court may need to approve. Highly complicated—proceed with caution.

**Scenario 4: Separated but not divorced**
Both spouses retain marital rights. Both must sign everything.

### Protecting Yourself in Divorce Deals

- Request a copy of the divorce decree
- Verify which spouse was awarded the property
- Check if a quitclaim deed was recorded
- Get both parties' contact information
- Consider requiring both signatures regardless of what decree says

## Clearing Title Issues

### The Resolution Process

1. **Identify the issue** through title search
2. **Determine who can resolve it** (seller, third party, court)
3. **Estimate time and cost** for resolution
4. **Decide whether to proceed** with the deal
5. **Execute the resolution** before or as condition of closing

### Common Resolution Methods

**Curative documents:** Corrective deeds, affidavits, and releases that fix errors or provide missing information. Most common and usually quickest.

**Lien negotiations:** Working with lienholders to accept reduced payoffs, especially for junior liens on underwater properties. Can save deals that otherwise couldn't close.

**Quiet title actions:** Lawsuits to establish ownership and eliminate competing claims. Used for serious clouds on title. Timeline: 3-12 months, cost: $2,000-$10,000+

**Indemnity agreements:** Title companies sometimes insure over minor defects if they're low risk. Requires title company approval.

### What You Can Do as the Wholesaler

- Order the title search early
- Communicate issues to sellers immediately
- Connect sellers with resources (title companies, attorneys)
- Adjust your contract timeline if resolution is possible
- Renegotiate price to account for resolution costs
- Walk away from deals with unsolvable issues

## Examples

### Example 1: The Hidden HELOC

You contract a property at $185,000. The seller owes $120,000 on the first mortgage and mentions no other debt. Your title search reveals a $45,000 HELOC with a $38,000 balance that the seller "forgot about."

**Analysis:**
- First mortgage: $120,000
- HELOC: $38,000
- Estimated closing costs: $8,000
- **Total needed to close: $166,000**
- Sale price: $185,000
- **Available for seller/wholesaler: $19,000**

With $19,000 of room, you could still wholesale this deal for $8,000-$12,000 if the buyer is paying cash or has minimal closing costs. Without that HELOC discovery, you might have promised the seller more than they could actually net.

### Example 2: The Judgment Surprise

You're working a deal on a $240,000 property with $170,000 in mortgage debt—seemingly $70,000 in equity. The title search shows a $55,000 judgment lien from a business lawsuit three years ago.

**Analysis:**
- First mortgage: $170,000
- Judgment lien: $55,000
- Property taxes owed: $4,500
- **Total liens: $229,500**

At $240,000 sale price, after closing costs there's barely enough to pay everyone. Options:
1. Negotiate with judgment creditor for reduced payoff (often accept 50-70 cents on dollar)
2. Reduce your assignment fee significantly
3. Walk away

You contact the judgment creditor's attorney and negotiate a $38,000 payoff, creating an additional $17,000 of room. Deal saved.

### Example 3: Probate Property Success

You find a property in probate worth $300,000. The estate has a $140,000 mortgage balance. The executor needs to sell quickly to distribute assets to heirs.

**Timeline considerations:**
- Probate opened: 2 months ago
- Letters Testamentary issued: Yes
- Court confirmation required: No (independent administration)
- Estimated closing timeline: 45-60 days

You contract at $245,000 with a 75-day closing window, leaving room for probate delays. Your buyer pays $255,000. The estate clears their debt, heirs receive distribution, and you earn $10,000 while providing a genuine solution.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not ordering title search before marketing to buyers**
You assign a contract for $15,000, then discover $40,000 in liens you didn't know about. Now you have to return your fee and damage your buyer relationship.

2. **Trusting seller's statements about debt**
Sellers forget about liens, lie about balances, or genuinely don't know what they owe. Always verify through title search and payoff statements.

3. **Ignoring "minor" liens**
That $3,500 judgment or $2,000 HOA lien can hold up a closing for weeks if not addressed early.

4. **Not building relationship with title companies**
Established relationships get you faster service, preliminary searches at reduced cost, and flexibility when issues arise.

5. **Underestimating probate timelines**
Promising a buyer 30-day closing on a probate property requiring court confirmation sets everyone up for failure.

6. **Assuming divorce decree solves everything**
The decree awards the property, but without a recorded deed, title is still clouded. Verify recorded documents, not just court orders.

7. **Not asking about recent work on the property**
That "recently renovated" property might have $30,000 in unpaid contractor bills about to become mechanic's liens.

8. **Skipping due diligence on "obvious" deals**
Even properties with seemingly clear title can have hidden issues. Never skip the title search.

9. **Not factoring resolution costs into negotiations**
If clearing a title issue costs $3,000, that's $3,000 less equity in the deal. Renegotiate your purchase price accordingly.

10. **Walking away from every title issue**
Many issues are resolvable with time and effort. A complicated title can mean less competition and better deals—if you know how to handle it.
