# The 70% Rule Explained: The Essential Formula for Calculating Maximum Allowable Offer in Real Estate Wholesaling

## Quick Reference

- **The Formula**: (ARV × 0.70) - Repair Costs = Maximum Allowable Offer (MAO)
- **The 30% margin** accounts for holding costs (3-5%), closing costs (3-5%), realtor fees (5-6%), and flipper profit (15-20%)
- **Adjust the percentage** based on market conditions: 65% in hot markets, 75-80% in buyer's markets
- **Never skip this calculation**—it's your first-line defense against bad deals
- **The rule is a starting point**, not a final answer—sophisticated investors use detailed cost analysis
- **Wholesalers must subtract their assignment fee** from the MAO to determine their maximum purchase price
- **Rental investors calculate differently**—they can often pay more because they measure returns through cash flow
- **The rule works best** for properties between $100K-$400K ARV in typical markets
- **Always verify ARV** with recent comparable sales before applying the formula

## What Is the 70% Rule?

The 70% Rule is the foundational formula used by real estate investors and wholesalers to quickly calculate the maximum price they should pay for a distressed property. This calculation ensures there's enough margin built into a deal for a house flipper to cover all their costs and still make a profit.

Here's the formula:

**(ARV × 0.70) - Repair Costs = Maximum Allowable Offer (MAO)**

Where:
- **ARV** = After Repair Value (what the property will sell for after renovations)
- **0.70** = 70% (the multiplier that creates the margin)
- **Repair Costs** = Estimated cost to renovate the property to market condition
- **MAO** = Maximum Allowable Offer (the highest price an investor should pay)

For example, if a property has an ARV of $200,000 and needs $30,000 in repairs:

($200,000 × 0.70) - $30,000 = $140,000 - $30,000 = **$110,000 MAO**

This means a flipper should pay no more than $110,000 for this property to maintain healthy profit margins.

## The Historical Origin: Why 70% Became the Standard

The 70% Rule emerged organically from experienced house flippers during the 1990s and early 2000s. Before sophisticated deal analysis software existed, investors needed a quick mental calculation they could perform at the kitchen table while talking to a motivated seller.

The 30% margin wasn't arbitrary—it came from tracking actual costs across thousands of flip transactions. Experienced flippers noticed their total expenses (excluding purchase price and repairs) consistently fell within a predictable range:

| Cost Category | Typical Range | Percentage of ARV |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Holding Costs | $4,000-$12,000 | 3-5% |
| Buying Closing Costs | $2,000-$6,000 | 1-3% |
| Selling Closing Costs | $3,000-$8,000 | 2-3% |
| Realtor Commissions | 5-6% of sale price | 5-6% |
| Investor Profit Target | Varies | 15-20% |
| **Total** | | **26-37%** |

Rounding to 30% provided a conservative buffer that accounted for cost overruns, market fluctuations, and unexpected expenses. The number was easy to remember and calculate mentally—you simply multiply by 0.70 and subtract repairs.

The rule spread through real estate investment clubs, early online forums, and mentorship programs. By the mid-2000s, it had become the universal language of deal analysis in the wholesaling and flipping communities.

## How the 70% Rule Accounts for All Costs

Understanding what the 30% margin covers helps you know when to adjust it. Let's break down each component:

### Holding Costs (3-5% of ARV)

Holding costs are expenses you incur while owning the property. The longer the renovation and sale process takes, the more these add up:

- **Property taxes**: Prorated based on holding period (typically $200-$800/month depending on location)
- **Insurance**: Vacant or renovation property insurance ($100-$300/month)
- **Utilities**: Electric, water, gas for construction crews ($150-$400/month)
- **Lawn care and maintenance**: Keeping the property from looking abandoned ($50-$150/month)
- **Loan interest**: If financing the purchase ($400-$2,000/month on hard money loans)
- **HOA fees**: If applicable ($100-$500/month)

On a $200,000 ARV property held for 4 months, holding costs typically run $4,000-$10,000.

### Closing Costs (3-5% of ARV)

These are transaction fees paid when buying and selling:

**When Buying:**
- Title search and insurance: $1,000-$2,500
- Attorney or escrow fees: $500-$1,500
- Recording fees: $100-$500
- Loan origination fees (if financing): 1-3% of loan amount

**When Selling:**
- Title insurance for buyer: $1,000-$2,500
- Transfer taxes: Varies by state (0.1%-2%)
- Attorney or escrow fees: $500-$1,500
- Home warranty (if offered): $400-$600

### Realtor Commissions (5-6% of ARV)

Most flippers use real estate agents to sell their completed renovations. The standard commission structure is:

- Listing agent commission: 2.5-3%
- Buyer's agent commission: 2.5-3%
- **Total**: 5-6% of the sale price

On a $200,000 sale, that's $10,000-$12,000 in commissions.

### Investor Profit (15-20% of ARV)

After all expenses, flippers target a profit margin that justifies the risk, effort, and capital deployed:

- **Minimum acceptable profit**: 10-12% (only for easy, low-risk deals)
- **Standard target profit**: 15-18%
- **Premium profit (high-risk deals)**: 20-25%

On a $200,000 ARV property, a flipper targets $30,000-$40,000 in profit.

## When to Adjust: Using 65%, 70%, 75%, or 80%

The 70% Rule is a baseline, not a rigid law. Sophisticated wholesalers adjust the percentage based on market conditions, property characteristics, and buyer expectations.

### Use 65% When:

**Hot Seller's Markets**
When properties sell quickly and multiple buyers compete for deals, flippers have tighter margins. They're willing to accept lower profits to stay active, but they need cushion for the rapid price fluctuations.

**Luxury or High-Value Properties ($500K+ ARV)**
Higher-priced properties carry more risk. Holding costs are higher, buyer pools are smaller, and market time is longer. A 2% mistake on a $1M property is $20,000.

**Extensive Renovations (6+ months)**
Longer projects mean more holding costs, more risk of market changes, and more opportunities for cost overruns. Budget accordingly.

**Uncertain Markets**
When economic indicators are mixed or trending downward, conservative pricing protects against declining values during the holding period.

**Properties with Unique Characteristics**
Unusual floor plans, challenging locations, or properties requiring specialized work need extra margin for the unexpected.

### Use 70% When:

**Balanced Markets**
Supply and demand are relatively equal, properties sell within 30-60 days, and price appreciation is stable at 2-4% annually.

**Standard Renovations (3-4 months)**
Typical cosmetic and moderate rehabs that follow predictable timelines.

**Properties in the $150K-$350K Range**
The sweet spot for most markets where buyer demand is strong and comparable sales are plentiful.

**Experienced Buyers**
When your buyer list includes proven flippers who know their numbers and can execute efficiently.

### Use 75% When:

**Buyer's Markets**
When inventory is high and properties sit for 90+ days, motivated flippers will work on thinner margins to stay busy.

**Light Cosmetic Rehabs**
Properties needing only paint, carpet, landscaping, and cleaning can be turned in 30-45 days, reducing holding costs significantly.

**High-Demand Neighborhoods**
Areas with strong school districts, low crime, and steady appreciation reduce risk for flippers.

**Cash Buyers with Low Costs**
Investors paying cash and selling FSBO have lower total expenses and can pay more.

### Use 80% When:

**Rental Investor Buyers**
Buy-and-hold investors measure returns differently (cash flow, cap rate) and can often pay more than flippers.

**Extremely Light Cosmetic Work**
Properties needing only $5,000-$10,000 in updates with quick turnaround potential.

**Desperate Market Conditions**
Deep buyer's markets where any deal activity is welcome.

**Wholesale to Owner-Occupant**
Occasionally, you'll find owner-occupants willing to pay near-retail for a property they'll renovate themselves over time.

## Limitations of the 70% Rule

While the 70% Rule is invaluable for quick analysis, it has significant limitations that sophisticated investors recognize:

### It Doesn't Account for Financing Costs Specifically

The rule assumes generic holding costs but doesn't differentiate between a cash buyer and someone using 12% hard money loans. A financed flip might need 65% while a cash buyer can work with 75%.

### It Assumes Average Market Conditions

The rule was developed during relatively stable market conditions. In rapidly appreciating or depreciating markets, the static 30% margin may be too conservative or dangerously thin.

### It Doesn't Work Well for All Property Types

- **Condos**: HOA fees and special assessments aren't captured
- **Multi-family**: Should use income-based valuation
- **Land**: Completely different analysis required
- **Commercial**: Cap rate analysis is standard

### It Ignores Time Value of Money

A deal that ties up capital for 8 months should require more margin than a 3-month flip, but the rule doesn't adjust for this.

### It Doesn't Consider the Wholesaler's Fee

When you're wholesaling, you need to subtract your assignment fee from the MAO to determine your maximum purchase price:

**Your Maximum Purchase Price = MAO - Your Wholesale Fee**

If the MAO is $110,000 and you want a $10,000 assignment fee, you can pay no more than $100,000.

### It Oversimplifies Repair Estimates

The rule treats repair costs as a simple line item, but actual renovation costs have significant variance based on contractor quality, material choices, and market conditions.

## Alternative Formulas Used by Sophisticated Investors

As you advance in your wholesaling career, consider these more detailed approaches:

### The Full Cost Analysis Formula

**MAO = ARV - Repairs - Holding Costs - Buying Costs - Selling Costs - Realtor Fees - Desired Profit - Wholesale Fee**

This itemized approach is more work but more accurate:

| Line Item | Calculation |
|-----------|-------------|
| ARV | $250,000 |
| Repairs | -$40,000 |
| Holding Costs (4 months × $1,500) | -$6,000 |
| Buying Closing Costs (2%) | -$3,400 |
| Selling Closing Costs (2%) | -$5,000 |
| Realtor Commissions (5.5%) | -$13,750 |
| Desired Profit (18%) | -$45,000 |
| Wholesale Fee | -$12,000 |
| **Maximum Purchase Price** | **$124,850** |

### The Sliding Scale Method

Adjust your percentage based on repair amounts:

- **Light rehab ($0-$20K repairs)**: Use 75%
- **Moderate rehab ($20K-$50K repairs)**: Use 70%
- **Heavy rehab ($50K+ repairs)**: Use 65%

The logic: larger rehabs carry more risk of cost overruns and longer timelines.

### The Per-Square-Foot Method

Some investors calculate separately:

1. Determine ARV per square foot from comps
2. Determine repair costs per square foot
3. Apply formula: (ARV/sqft × 0.70 - Repairs/sqft) × Total Square Feet = MAO

This method helps normalize calculations across different property sizes.

## Examples at Different Price Points

### Example 1: $100,000 ARV Property (Starter Home)

**Property Details:**
- 3 bed, 1 bath, 1,100 sq ft
- Needs full cosmetic rehab: paint, flooring, kitchen/bath updates, landscaping
- Estimated repairs: $18,000
- Market: Balanced suburban area

**Standard 70% Calculation:**
($100,000 × 0.70) - $18,000 = $70,000 - $18,000 = **$52,000 MAO**

**Wholesaler Adjustment (targeting $7,000 fee):**
$52,000 - $7,000 = **$45,000 maximum purchase price**

**Why This Works:**
At a $45,000 purchase price, the flipper's total investment is $63,000 ($45,000 + $18,000). They'll sell for $100,000, netting approximately $22,000-$27,000 after all costs—a solid 22-27% return.

### Example 2: $250,000 ARV Property (Standard Single-Family)

**Property Details:**
- 4 bed, 2 bath, 1,800 sq ft
- Needs moderate rehab: new HVAC, roof repairs, full interior update
- Estimated repairs: $45,000
- Market: Competitive suburban area

**Standard 70% Calculation:**
($250,000 × 0.70) - $45,000 = $175,000 - $45,000 = **$130,000 MAO**

**Wholesaler Adjustment (targeting $12,000 fee):**
$130,000 - $12,000 = **$118,000 maximum purchase price**

**Alternative 65% Calculation (if hot market or extended timeline):**
($250,000 × 0.65) - $45,000 = $162,500 - $45,000 = **$117,500 MAO**

### Example 3: $500,000 ARV Property (Higher-End Home)

**Property Details:**
- 5 bed, 3 bath, 3,200 sq ft
- Needs significant renovation: kitchen gut, master bath remodel, systems updates
- Estimated repairs: $85,000
- Market: Affluent suburb with 60+ day market times

**Conservative 65% Calculation:**
($500,000 × 0.65) - $85,000 = $325,000 - $85,000 = **$240,000 MAO**

**Wholesaler Adjustment (targeting $18,000 fee):**
$240,000 - $18,000 = **$222,000 maximum purchase price**

**Why Use 65%:**
Higher-priced properties have smaller buyer pools, longer selling times, and higher carrying costs. The extra 5% margin ($25,000) provides crucial protection.

### Example 4: $1,000,000 ARV Property (Luxury Market)

**Property Details:**
- 6 bed, 5 bath, 5,500 sq ft
- Extensive renovation: full modernization, pool repair, outdoor living
- Estimated repairs: $150,000
- Market: Luxury enclave with 90+ day market times

**Very Conservative 60% Calculation:**
($1,000,000 × 0.60) - $150,000 = $600,000 - $150,000 = **$450,000 MAO**

**Wholesaler Adjustment (targeting $25,000 fee):**
$450,000 - $25,000 = **$425,000 maximum purchase price**

**Why Use 60%:**
Luxury properties carry substantial risk:
- Longer hold times (6-12 months common)
- Higher carrying costs ($3,000-$5,000/month)
- Smaller buyer pools
- Greater renovation cost variance
- Higher stakes for design decisions

Even at $450,000, the flipper invests $600,000 ($450,000 + $150,000) plus $30,000+ in holding costs. They need that $200,000+ gross margin to net $120,000-$150,000 after all expenses.

## How to Adjust for Rental vs. Flip Exit Strategies

When your buyer is a rental investor rather than a flipper, the math changes significantly. Rental investors value properties based on income potential, not resale margin.

### Why Rental Investors Can Pay More

1. **Different success metrics**: Cash flow, cap rate, and cash-on-cash return matter more than ARV margin
2. **Longer timeline reduces urgency**: They're holding for years, not months
3. **Appreciation builds wealth**: They'll benefit from market growth
4. **Tax advantages**: Depreciation, mortgage interest deduction, and 1031 exchanges
5. **Refinancing options**: BRRRR strategy allows them to pull capital out

### Rental Investor Calculation Methods

**Method 1: The 75-80% Rule**
For rental buyers, increase the percentage to 75-80%:
($200,000 ARV × 0.75) - $25,000 repairs = **$125,000 MAO**

**Method 2: The 1% Rule Check**
Monthly rent should equal 1% of total investment:
- If monthly rent is $1,800
- Total investment (purchase + repairs) should be ≤ $180,000
- If repairs are $25,000, maximum purchase is $155,000

**Method 3: Cash-on-Cash Return**
Target 8-12% annual cash-on-cash return:

| Line Item | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Annual Gross Rent | $21,600 |
| Vacancy (8%) | -$1,728 |
| Property Management (10%) | -$2,160 |
| Repairs/Maintenance (10%) | -$2,160 |
| Insurance | -$1,400 |
| Property Taxes | -$2,400 |
| **Net Operating Income** | **$11,752** |

For 10% cash-on-cash return on a cash purchase:
$11,752 ÷ 0.10 = $117,520 maximum total investment

**Method 4: Cap Rate Analysis**
Cap Rate = NOI ÷ Property Value

If target cap rate is 8%:
$11,752 ÷ 0.08 = $146,900 maximum property value (including purchase + repairs)

### Presenting Deals to Rental Investors

When marketing to rental buyers, provide:
- Current or estimated monthly rent
- Rent-to-value ratio
- Estimated cap rate after stabilization
- Cash flow projection
- Comparable rental rates in the area

This information helps rental investors quickly assess whether the deal meets their criteria, even if the 70% Rule suggests a higher discount than they need.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Using the Wrong ARV
**The Problem**: Inflating ARV to make deals work on paper leads to failed deals and damaged relationships.
**The Solution**: Use conservative ARV estimates based on actual closed sales from the past 90 days. When in doubt, use the lower end of your comp range.

### Mistake 2: Forgetting to Subtract Your Wholesale Fee
**The Problem**: Calculating MAO and offering that amount leaves no room for your profit.
**The Solution**: Always calculate: Your Max Purchase = MAO - Your Desired Fee

### Mistake 3: Applying 70% to Every Deal
**The Problem**: Using 70% in hot markets loses deals; using 70% in high-risk situations loses money.
**The Solution**: Assess each deal individually. Consider market conditions, property characteristics, timeline, and buyer type.

### Mistake 4: Underestimating Repairs
**The Problem**: Repair estimates that are too low destroy the margin the 70% Rule is designed to protect.
**The Solution**: Always build in a 10-20% contingency on repair estimates. Get contractor input on larger rehabs.

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Holding Costs
**The Problem**: Assuming the 30% margin covers everything regardless of timeline leads to surprises.
**The Solution**: Add explicit holding cost calculations for any project expected to exceed 4 months.

### Mistake 6: Not Knowing Your Buyer's Criteria
**The Problem**: Calculating deals without knowing what your buyers actually need.
**The Solution**: Survey your buyers. Know who uses 65%, who accepts 75%, and who buys for rental purposes.

### Mistake 7: Applying the Rule to Inappropriate Property Types
**The Problem**: Using the 70% Rule for condos, multi-family, or land leads to inaccurate analysis.
**The Solution**: Learn property-type-specific analysis methods. Use income approach for rentals, per-unit analysis for multi-family.

### Mistake 8: Trusting Online ARV Estimates
**The Problem**: Zillow, Redfin, and other automated valuations can be significantly off, especially for distressed properties.
**The Solution**: Always verify ARV with actual comparable sales. Walk the neighborhood, analyze recent closings, and consider consulting a real estate agent.

### Mistake 9: Using List Prices Instead of Sold Prices
**The Problem**: Active listings reflect asking prices, not market value.
**The Solution**: Base ARV calculations only on closed sales. Adjust for market movement if comps are more than 90 days old.

### Mistake 10: Rushing the Calculation
**The Problem**: Pressure to make quick offers leads to math errors and missed factors.
**The Solution**: Develop a consistent analysis process. Use a spreadsheet or calculator tool. Double-check your numbers before committing.
