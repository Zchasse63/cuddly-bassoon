## Understanding Wholesale Contracts

Real estate wholesaling lives and dies by the quality of your contracts. A well-written contract protects your interests, establishes your legal position, and ensures you can successfully assign the deal to an end buyer. A poorly written contract leaves you exposed to lawsuits, lost earnest money, and deals that fall apart at the closing table.

At its core, wholesaling involves two contracts: the **Purchase and Sale Agreement** between you and the seller, and the **Assignment of Contract** between you and your end buyer. Understanding both is essential before you put your first property under contract.

Your contract is not just paperwork—it's a legally binding document that creates what's called **equitable interest** in the property. This equitable interest is what you're selling to your buyer. Without a proper contract, you have nothing to sell.

## The Purchase and Sale Agreement Essentials

The Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA) is your primary contract with the seller. This document establishes all the terms of your transaction and must include several critical elements to be enforceable.

### Core Components Every PSA Must Include

**Property Identification**: The complete legal description and property address. Never rely solely on a street address—include the parcel number and legal description from county records.

**Purchase Price**: The exact amount you're agreeing to pay. Be specific: "$145,000" not "around $145K."

**Buyer Identification**: Your name or your company name followed by "and/or assigns." This language is critical—it establishes your right to assign from the very first line.

**Seller Identification**: The legal owner(s) of the property. Verify ownership through title search before finalizing.

**Closing Date**: A specific date or timeline. Use language like "on or before 30 days from the effective date" to give yourself flexibility.

**Earnest Money Details**: Amount, where it's held, and conditions for refund or forfeiture.

**Contingencies**: Your escape clauses that allow you to exit the contract under specific conditions.

**Signatures and Dates**: All parties must sign and date the agreement.

### The "And/Or Assigns" Language

The phrase "and/or assigns" after your name as the buyer is your first line of defense for assignment rights. It should appear in the opening paragraph where the buyer is identified:

*"Buyer: ABC Investments LLC, and/or assigns"*

This language notifies the seller from the outset that you may transfer your interest to another party. Some wholesalers skip this and rely solely on the assignment clause—don't make that mistake. Belt and suspenders.

## Required Contingencies

Contingencies are conditional clauses that allow you to cancel the contract without penalty if certain conditions aren't met. For wholesalers, four contingencies are essential.

### Inspection Contingency

This is your primary exit strategy. The inspection contingency allows you to cancel if you're not satisfied with the property's condition—for any reason.

**Strong language example:**
*"Buyer shall have 14 business days from the effective date to conduct inspections of the property. Buyer may cancel this agreement for any reason related to the physical condition of the property by providing written notice to Seller before the inspection period expires. Upon cancellation, Buyer's earnest money deposit shall be returned in full."*

The inspection contingency isn't just about finding problems—it's your safety valve while you find a buyer. Most wholesalers use this period to market the property and secure an end buyer.

### Title Contingency

This contingency protects you if there are title defects, liens, or encumbrances that make the property unmarketable.

**Essential language:**
*"This agreement is contingent upon Buyer receiving a title commitment showing marketable title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances except current year taxes and standard exceptions. Buyer shall have 10 business days from receipt of title commitment to review and approve or cancel this agreement."*

### Financing Contingency (Optional for Wholesalers)

Traditional financing contingencies protect buyers who need mortgage approval. As a wholesaler, you typically won't need traditional financing, but including this contingency provides another exit option.

**Strategic use:**
*"This agreement is contingent upon Buyer obtaining financing satisfactory to Buyer within 21 days of the effective date."*

This is intentionally vague—"satisfactory to Buyer" means you decide what's acceptable.

### Assignment Clause

The assignment clause explicitly grants you the right to transfer your contract to another party. While "and/or assigns" in the buyer line helps, a dedicated clause is stronger.

## Assignment Clause Language and Placement

Your assignment clause is the legal foundation of your wholesale business. It must be clear, unambiguous, and prominently placed.

### Recommended Assignment Clause Language

*"Buyer may assign this agreement, in whole or in part, to any third party without Seller's consent. Upon assignment, the original Buyer shall be released from all obligations under this agreement, and the Assignee shall assume all Buyer's rights and obligations. The assignment fee, if any, paid to Buyer by the Assignee is separate consideration and shall not affect the purchase price or Seller's proceeds."*

### Alternative Stronger Language

*"Buyer retains the absolute and unconditional right to assign, transfer, sell, or convey any or all of Buyer's interest in this agreement to any individual, entity, trust, corporation, or LLC at any time prior to closing without notice to or consent from Seller. This right of assignment is a material term of this agreement."*

### Placement Strategy

Place your assignment clause in the main body of the contract—ideally in the first few pages. Do not bury it in addenda or the final paragraphs. When sellers later claim they "didn't know" about assignment rights, having it prominently placed protects you.

Some wholesalers include it in three places: the buyer identification line, a dedicated clause in the body, and an assignment addendum. Redundancy protects you.

## Earnest Money: Amounts, Timing, and Refundability

Earnest money demonstrates your good faith commitment to purchase. As a wholesaler, you want to deposit enough to be taken seriously while minimizing your risk.

### Typical Earnest Money Amounts

| Property Value | Distressed/Motivated Seller | Traditional Sale |
|----------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| Under $100,000 | $100 - $500 | $500 - $1,000 |
| $100,000 - $250,000 | $500 - $1,000 | $1,000 - $2,500 |
| $250,000 - $500,000 | $1,000 - $2,500 | $2,500 - $5,000 |
| Over $500,000 | $2,500 - $5,000 | $5,000 - $10,000 |

With highly motivated sellers, you can often negotiate $100-$500 regardless of property value. The more motivated the seller, the less earnest money required.

### When Earnest Money Is Due

Standard practice requires earnest money within **2-3 business days** of contract execution. Your contract should specify:

*"Buyer shall deposit earnest money of $500 with [Title Company Name] within 3 business days of the effective date of this agreement."*

Never deposit earnest money directly with the seller—always use a neutral third party like a title company or attorney.

### Refundability Conditions

Your earnest money should be fully refundable if you cancel during any contingency period. Ensure your contract explicitly states:

*"If Buyer cancels this agreement during any contingency period, earnest money shall be returned to Buyer within 5 business days of written cancellation notice."*

After contingencies expire, earnest money typically becomes non-refundable (goes "hard"). This is why proper contingency periods are crucial.

## Contract Timelines and Deadlines

Every deadline in your contract matters. Missing a deadline can cost you your earnest money or your deal.

### Standard Wholesale Timeline

**Day 0**: Contract executed (both parties sign)
**Day 1-3**: Earnest money deposited
**Day 1-14**: Inspection period (market to buyers)
**Day 7-10**: Title commitment received and reviewed
**Day 14-21**: Due diligence completed, contingencies removed
**Day 21-45**: Closing

### Critical Deadlines to Track

1. **Earnest money deposit deadline** - Miss this and your contract may be voidable
2. **Inspection contingency expiration** - After this, you can't cancel for property issues
3. **Title review period** - Approve or object to title issues
4. **Contingency removal deadline** - When your money goes hard
5. **Closing date** - When the deal must fund and record

Build in buffer time. If you need 21 days to find a buyer, ask for 30. Sellers rarely object to reasonable timelines.

## What Makes a Contract Legally Binding

For your wholesale contract to be enforceable, it must contain six essential elements:

### 1. Offer and Acceptance
One party makes an offer, the other accepts. Counteroffers void the original offer—a counteroffer requires new acceptance.

### 2. Consideration
Something of value must be exchanged. Your earnest money serves as consideration. Even $10 is legally sufficient.

### 3. Legal Capacity
All parties must be legally competent to enter contracts—at least 18 years old and mentally competent.

### 4. Lawful Purpose
The contract must be for legal purposes. Real estate transactions for legal properties qualify.

### 5. Mutual Consent
Both parties must understand and agree to the terms. No fraud, duress, or misrepresentation.

### 6. Proper Documentation
Real estate contracts must be in writing (Statute of Frauds) and signed by all parties with authority.

## The Assignment of Contract Document

When you find a buyer, you'll execute an Assignment of Contract that transfers your interest in the purchase agreement.

### Essential Elements

**Original Contract Reference**: Identify the original PSA by date, parties, and property address.

**Assignment Fee**: The exact amount your buyer pays for your position. Example: "$12,500 payable at closing."

**Release Language**: Whether you remain liable if the assignee defaults.

**Deposit Requirements**: What your buyer pays upfront (typically non-refundable).

### Sample Assignment Language

*"For good and valuable consideration of $12,500 (the "Assignment Fee"), receipt of which is acknowledged, [Your Company] ("Assignor") hereby assigns, transfers, and conveys all rights, title, and interest in that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement dated [Date] between Assignor as Buyer and [Seller Name] as Seller for the property located at [Address] to [Buyer Name] ("Assignee").*

*Assignee agrees to assume all obligations of Buyer under the original agreement. Assignee shall deposit $3,000 as a non-refundable deposit with [Title Company] within 48 hours of executing this assignment, with the remaining $9,500 due at closing."*

## When to Use Double-Close Instead

Assignment isn't always the best strategy. Double-closing (also called simultaneous closing or back-to-back closing) involves two separate transactions: you buy from the seller, then immediately sell to your buyer.

### Use Double-Close When:

**Assignment fee exceeds $15,000-$20,000**: Large assignment fees can upset sellers or buyers. Double-closing keeps your profit private.

**Seller prohibited assignment**: Some motivated sellers still refuse assignment rights. Double-close keeps the original transaction simple.

**Buyer objects to fee transparency**: Some end buyers don't want sellers knowing their purchase price. Double-closing creates separate transactions.

**Institutional seller requirements**: Banks, HUD, and VA often prohibit assignments. Double-close is your only option.

**Your profit exceeds 30-40% of seller's price**: If you're buying at $60,000 and selling at $100,000, a $40,000 assignment fee might kill the deal. Double-closing prevents sticker shock.

### Double-Close Considerations

- Requires investor-friendly title company
- May need transactional funding (short-term loans)
- Two sets of closing costs
- Timing must be coordinated carefully

## Working with Title Companies

Your title company relationship is critical. Not all title companies work with wholesalers—you need one that understands and welcomes your business model.

### Finding Investor-Friendly Title Companies

Ask these questions when interviewing title companies:

1. "Do you handle assignment of contract closings?"
2. "Do you work with transactional funding for double-closes?"
3. "How quickly can you close once all documents are ready?"
4. "What are your fees for wholesale transactions?"
5. "Do you require seasoning periods?"

### Title Company's Role in Wholesale Deals

- Holds earnest money in escrow
- Conducts title search and issues title commitment
- Prepares closing documents
- Facilitates closing and fund disbursement
- Records deed transfer with the county

Build relationships with 2-3 investor-friendly title companies before you need them. Nothing kills deals faster than a title company that won't close your transaction.

## State-Specific Requirements Overview

Wholesaling laws vary significantly by state. Understanding your state's requirements isn't optional—it's essential.

### Attorney States

These states require attorney involvement in real estate closings:
- Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, and others

In attorney states, work with a real estate attorney familiar with wholesale transactions.

### Disclosure Requirements

Some states require specific disclosures about your role as a wholesaler:
- **Illinois**: Specific disclosure requirements for "investor buyers"
- **Ohio**: Recent legislation clarifying wholesale activities
- **Texas**: Generally wholesaler-friendly but requires proper contract language

### Licensing Considerations

The question of whether wholesalers need real estate licenses is state-specific and evolving. Generally, you're safe if:
- You have equitable interest (signed contract)
- You're selling your contract interest, not the property itself
- You don't market properties you don't have under contract

When in doubt, consult a real estate attorney in your state.

## Examples

### Example 1: Standard Assignment Deal

**The Situation**: You find a motivated seller with a 3-bedroom home worth $220,000 in good condition. The seller owes $95,000 and will accept $125,000 to walk away with cash.

**Your Contract**:
- Purchase price: $125,000
- Earnest money: $500
- Inspection period: 14 days
- Closing timeline: 30 days

**Finding Your Buyer**: During the inspection period, you market to your cash buyer list. An investor agrees to pay $142,000.

**Your Assignment**:
- Assignment fee: $17,000
- Buyer deposit: $5,000 (non-refundable)
- Balance due at closing: $12,000

**At Closing**:
- Seller receives $125,000 (as agreed)
- You receive $17,000 (your assignment fee)
- Buyer receives property for $142,000
- Buyer's all-in investment: $142,000 + repairs + closing costs

### Example 2: Double-Close Scenario

**The Situation**: Bank-owned property (REO) listed at $85,000. After negotiation, bank accepts $72,000. Assignment prohibited per bank requirements.

**Transaction A (Your Purchase)**:
- Purchase price: $72,000
- You use transactional funding: $72,000 at 2% fee ($1,440)

**Transaction B (Your Sale)**:
- Sale price to end buyer: $92,000
- Buyer's funds received at closing

**Your Proceeds**:
- Gross spread: $20,000
- Less transactional funding fee: $1,440
- Less additional closing costs: ~$1,500
- Net profit: ~$17,060

### Example 3: Deal Falls Apart—Using Contingencies

**The Situation**: You contract a property for $165,000 with a 14-day inspection period. After 10 days of marketing, no buyers materialize at your $185,000 asking price.

**Your Exit**: On day 13, you send written notice invoking your inspection contingency: "Buyer hereby cancels this agreement pursuant to the inspection contingency. Please return earnest money of $500 to Buyer within 5 business days."

**Result**: Your earnest money is returned. You move on to the next deal without liability.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Not Including "And/Or Assigns"
Forgetting this language in the buyer identification leaves you fighting to prove assignment rights. Always include it.

### 2. Burying the Assignment Clause
Hiding the clause in addenda or fine print invites disputes. Place it prominently in the main contract body.

### 3. Depositing Too Much Earnest Money
New wholesalers often deposit $5,000+ thinking it looks professional. You're just increasing your risk. Start with $500 or less on distressed properties.

### 4. Missing Contingency Deadlines
Your inspection period expires while you're still finding buyers—now your earnest money is at risk. Track every deadline religiously.

### 5. Using Generic Contracts
Downloading a standard purchase agreement without modification leaves out critical wholesale provisions. Customize your contracts.

### 6. Not Verifying Ownership
You contract with someone who doesn't actually own the property. Always verify ownership through title search before going hard.

### 7. Working with Wholesaler-Unfriendly Title Companies
Finding out at closing that your title company won't process assignments wastes everyone's time. Vet title companies in advance.

### 8. Ignoring State Requirements
Operating without understanding your state's specific laws puts your business at risk. Consult local professionals.

### 9. Verbal Agreements About Key Terms
"The seller said I could have an extra week" means nothing without a written amendment. Document everything.

### 10. Failing to Get All Signatures
Missing a spouse's signature, a co-owner, or someone with power of attorney can void your entire contract. Verify all required parties sign.
