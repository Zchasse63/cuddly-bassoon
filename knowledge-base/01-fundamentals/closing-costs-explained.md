# Closing Costs Explained: A Complete Guide for Real Estate Wholesalers

## Quick Reference

- **Total closing costs typically range from 1-3% of sale price** for cash wholesale transactions, significantly less than traditional financed purchases (3-6%)
- **Sellers in wholesale deals commonly pay 1-2%** of the sale price in closing costs (title insurance, prorated taxes, recording fees)
- **Buyers typically pay 0.5-1.5%** in closing costs for cash purchases (title insurance, recording fees, escrow fees)
- **Assignment closings cost less** than double closings—often $500-1,500 versus $2,000-5,000 for double closes
- **Transfer taxes vary dramatically by state**: From $0 in Texas to $22.50+ per $1,000 in Pennsylvania
- **Title insurance is the largest single closing cost** in most transactions, typically 0.5-1% of purchase price
- **Prorated items include property taxes, HOA dues, and utilities**—calculate from closing date through billing period end
- **Who pays what is negotiable**—everything can be structured to fit the deal, but know market norms
- **Double-close costs include TWO sets of title insurance, recording fees, and transfer taxes**
- **Always disclose your assignment fee** in states that require it and when ethically appropriate

## Understanding Closing Costs in Wholesaling

Closing costs are the transactional expenses required to complete a real estate transfer beyond the purchase price itself. As a wholesaler, understanding these costs is critical because they directly impact your Maximum Allowable Offer (MAO) calculations, your buyer's profit margins, and your ability to structure deals that work for everyone.

Unlike traditional real estate transactions involving mortgages, wholesale deals are typically cash transactions. This eliminates lender-related fees (loan origination, appraisal, mortgage insurance) and significantly reduces total closing costs. However, you still face title-related costs, government fees, and transaction-specific expenses.

The key insight for wholesalers: **closing costs eat into profit margins**. If you don't account for them properly when making offers or presenting deals to buyers, you'll either leave money on the table or create deals that don't pencil out.

## Buyer-Side Closing Costs

Your end buyer—whether a fix-and-flip investor, landlord, or another wholesaler—will incur specific closing costs. Understanding these helps you present accurate deals and maintain credibility with your buyers list.

### Standard Buyer Closing Costs

**Title Insurance (Owner's Policy)**
- Cost: 0.5-1% of purchase price
- Purpose: Protects buyer against title defects, liens, and ownership claims
- Who pays: Varies by state custom (buyer pays in most states)
- Example: $750-$1,500 on a $150,000 purchase

**Settlement/Escrow Fee**
- Cost: $300-$800 (flat fee or split with seller)
- Purpose: Pays the title company or attorney for conducting the closing
- Note: Often split 50/50 between buyer and seller

**Recording Fees**
- Cost: $50-$150
- Purpose: Records the deed with the county
- Paid to: County recorder's office

**Title Search and Examination**
- Cost: $150-$400
- Purpose: Research property's ownership history and identify liens
- Note: Sometimes bundled into title insurance premium

**Wire Transfer Fee**
- Cost: $25-$50
- Purpose: Securely transfer funds to closing
- Note: Cash buyers using wire transfers pay this fee

**Courier/Document Preparation Fees**
- Cost: $50-$150
- Purpose: Prepare closing documents and deliver them
- Note: Some title companies bundle this; others itemize separately

### Total Buyer Closing Cost Estimate

For a typical **$100,000 cash wholesale purchase**:
- Owner's title insurance: $600
- Settlement fee (half): $250
- Recording fee: $75
- Title search: $200
- Wire fee: $35
- Document prep: $75
- **Total: $1,235 (1.24% of purchase price)**

## Seller-Side Closing Costs

When negotiating with motivated sellers, you need to explain what they'll pay at closing. This affects their net proceeds and your ability to reach agreement on price.

### Standard Seller Closing Costs

**Title Insurance (Owner's Policy)**
- Cost: 0.5-1% of sale price
- Who pays: Seller in many states (regional custom)
- Note: This is the **same policy** as mentioned above—the question is who pays for it

**Transfer Taxes/Documentary Stamps**
- Cost: Varies dramatically by state ($0 to $22+ per $1,000)
- Purpose: State/county tax on property transfer
- Note: Seller typically pays, but negotiable

**Settlement/Escrow Fee**
- Cost: $300-$800 (or half)
- Purpose: Same as buyer's portion
- Note: Often split 50/50

**Prorated Property Taxes**
- Cost: Varies based on timing
- Purpose: Seller pays their share of property taxes through closing date
- Calculation: Annual tax ÷ 365 × days owned in current period

**HOA Transfer Fee**
- Cost: $100-$500
- Purpose: Process ownership change in HOA records
- Note: Only applies to properties with HOA

**Outstanding Liens**
- Cost: Varies
- Purpose: Must be paid to deliver clear title
- Examples: Mortgage payoff, mechanics liens, tax liens, judgments

**Recording Fees (Satisfaction of Mortgage)**
- Cost: $50-$100
- Purpose: Record mortgage release
- Note: Only applies if property has existing mortgage

### Total Seller Closing Cost Estimate

For a typical **$80,000 wholesale sale** (seller's perspective):
- Title insurance: $500 (if seller pays per local custom)
- Transfer tax (example: $2 per $1,000): $160
- Settlement fee (half): $250
- Prorated taxes (example): $400
- HOA transfer fee: $150
- Recording (mortgage satisfaction): $75
- **Total: $1,535 (1.92% of sale price)**

## Wholesaler-Specific Costs

As a wholesaler, you face unique costs depending on your exit strategy. Understanding these costs helps you price deals correctly and choose the right closing method.

### Assignment Closing Costs

When assigning your contract to an end buyer:

**Assignment Fee Considerations**
- Your assignment fee is **NOT a closing cost**—it's your profit
- However, assignment fees must often be disclosed on the HUD-1 or closing disclosure
- Some title companies charge a **contract assignment processing fee**: $100-$300
- Your buyer sees exactly what you're making (transparency requirement in most states)

**Typical Assignment Closing Costs (to Wholesaler)**
- Assignment processing fee: $100-$300
- Earnest money deposit: Refunded at closing (not a cost)
- Marketing costs: Variable (separate from closing)
- **Total: $100-$300**

### Double-Close Costs

Double closing (simultaneous closing) involves TWO transactions, meaning you pay closing costs as both a buyer (A-B transaction) AND a seller (B-C transaction).

**A-B Transaction (You as Buyer)**
- Title insurance (if required): $400-$800
- Settlement fee: $300-$500
- Recording fees: $75-$150
- Wire transfer fee: $35-$50

**B-C Transaction (You as Seller)**
- Title insurance: $400-$800
- Transfer taxes: State-dependent
- Settlement fee: $300-$500
- Recording fees: $75-$150

**Total Double-Close Costs (Wholesaler)**
- Low estimate: $1,500-$2,500
- High estimate (high transfer tax state): $3,000-$5,000
- **Typical range: $2,000-$3,500**

This is why double closing only makes sense when your assignment fee is large enough to justify the additional costs—typically when you're making $10,000+ on the deal.

## Title Insurance Explained

Title insurance is often the largest single closing cost. Understanding it helps you estimate costs accurately and explain the process to sellers and buyers.

### Types of Title Insurance

**Owner's Policy**
- Protects the property buyer/owner
- One-time premium at closing
- Coverage equals purchase price
- Remains in effect as long as owner (or heirs) have interest in property

**Lender's Policy**
- Protects the mortgage lender
- Required by lenders for financed purchases
- **Not applicable to most wholesale cash deals**
- Coverage equals loan amount

### Title Insurance Rates by State (Approximate)

Rates per $1,000 of coverage:

| State | Rate per $1,000 | $100K Policy Cost |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Texas | $5.80 | $580 |
| Florida | $5.75 | $575 |
| California | $2.50-$4.00 | $250-$400 |
| Ohio | $4.00-$5.00 | $400-$500 |
| Pennsylvania | $4.50-$5.50 | $450-$550 |
| Georgia | $4.00-$5.00 | $400-$500 |
| North Carolina | $2.00-$2.50 | $200-$250 |
| New York | $4.50-$6.00 | $450-$600 |

Note: Rates vary by county and title company. These are estimates—always get actual quotes.

### Who Pays for Title Insurance (Custom by State)

**Seller typically pays**: Florida, Texas (some areas), New York, Ohio
**Buyer typically pays**: California, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado
**Split or negotiable**: Most other states

Regardless of custom, **everything is negotiable** in a wholesale transaction.

## State-by-State Transfer Taxes and Recording Fees

Transfer taxes (also called documentary stamps, deed stamps, or conveyance taxes) vary dramatically and significantly impact closing costs in certain states.

### Transfer Tax Rates by State

**No Transfer Tax States**
- Alaska, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Wyoming

**Low Transfer Tax States (Under $2 per $1,000)**
- Arizona: $2 flat fee
- Colorado: $0.01 per $100 ($0.10 per $1,000)
- Nevada: $1.95 per $500 ($3.90 per $1,000)

**Moderate Transfer Tax States ($2-$5 per $1,000)**
- California: $1.10 per $1,000 (county) + local taxes
- Florida: $7.00 per $1,000 (documentary stamps)
- Georgia: $1.00 per $1,000
- Illinois: $1.00 per $1,000 (state) + local taxes
- New York: $4.00 per $1,000 + mansion tax over $1M

**High Transfer Tax States ($5+ per $1,000)**
- Connecticut: $7.50-$10.00 per $1,000
- Delaware: $15.00 per $1,000 (4% total)
- Maryland: $5.00-$6.00 per $1,000

- Pennsylvania: $10.00-$22.50 per $1,000 (varies by county)
- Washington, DC: $11.00-$14.50 per $1,000

### Impact Example: $150,000 Property

| State | Transfer Tax Rate | Transfer Tax Cost |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Texas | $0 | $0 |
| Georgia | $1.00 per $1,000 | $150 |
| Florida | $7.00 per $1,000 | $1,050 |
| Pennsylvania | $15.00 per $1,000 | $2,250 |

This $2,250 difference significantly impacts your MAO calculation in high-tax states.

### Recording Fees

Recording fees are relatively consistent across states:
- **Deed recording**: $25-$100
- **Mortgage recording** (if applicable): $50-$150
- **Satisfaction of mortgage**: $25-$75
- **Per-page fees**: Some counties charge $5-$15 per additional page

## Estimating Closing Costs as a Percentage

Use these rules of thumb for quick estimates, then refine with actual quotes.

### Quick Estimation Formula

**Cash Wholesale Transaction (Assignment)**
- Total closing costs: 1-2% of sale price
- Seller pays: 1-1.5%
- Buyer pays: 0.5-1%

**Cash Wholesale Transaction (Double-Close)**
- Total closing costs: 2-4% of sale price
- First closing: 1-2%
- Second closing: 1-2%

### Detailed Estimation Worksheet

For a **$120,000 wholesale transaction** in a moderate-tax state:

**Seller-Side Estimate:**
- Title insurance: $720 (0.6%)
- Transfer tax: $240 (0.2%)
- Settlement fee: $300 (0.25%)
- Prorated taxes: $300 (0.25%)
- Recording: $50 (0.04%)
- **Seller Total: $1,610 (1.34%)**

**Buyer-Side Estimate:**
- Settlement fee: $300 (0.25%)
- Recording: $75 (0.06%)
- Title search: $200 (0.17%)
- Wire/misc: $100 (0.08%)
- **Buyer Total: $675 (0.56%)**

**Combined Total: $2,285 (1.9%)**

## Negotiating Who Pays What

In wholesale deals with motivated sellers, you have significant leverage to negotiate closing cost allocation. Here's how to approach it strategically.

### Negotiation Strategies

**With Motivated Sellers:**
- Seller paying all closing costs is common for distressed situations
- Frame it as "net to you" pricing—quote what they'll receive after all costs
- Use closing cost credits instead of price reductions for cleaner numbers
- Example: "You'll walk away with $75,000 net—we handle all the closing paperwork and costs"

**With Cash Buyers:**
- Sophisticated investors expect to pay standard buyer closing costs
- Offering to cover some costs can sweeten marginal deals
- Never absorb costs without adjusting your profit margin accordingly

### What's Negotiable vs. Fixed

**Highly Negotiable:**
- Who pays title insurance
- Who pays settlement/escrow fees
- How prorations are calculated
- Seller concessions/credits

**Rarely Negotiable:**
- Transfer taxes (statutory—someone must pay)
- Recording fees (statutory)
- Outstanding liens (must be cleared)

### Negotiation Scripts

**Explaining to Sellers:**
"At closing, there are standard costs like title insurance and recording fees. On a sale at this price, you can expect those to run about $1,500-$2,000. I've already factored that into my offer so there won't be any surprises—you'll net [specific amount]."

**Negotiating with Title Company:**
"I bring you 3-4 deals per month. What kind of volume discount can you offer on settlement fees and title insurance premiums?"

## Double-Close vs. Assignment: Cost Comparison

Choosing between assignment and double-closing affects your bottom line. Here's a detailed comparison.

### Side-by-Side Cost Comparison

**Scenario: $100,000 A-B, $125,000 B-C, $25,000 Spread**

| Cost Category | Assignment | Double-Close |
|---------------|------------|--------------|
| Your closing costs | $200 | $2,800 |
| Your gross profit | $25,000 | $25,000 |
| Your net profit | $24,800 | $22,200 |
| Fee visibility | Fully visible | Hidden |

### When to Choose Each Method

**Choose Assignment When:**
- Assignment fee is under $10,000
- You're comfortable with fee transparency
- Seller and buyer are aware of your role
- Speed is important (simpler closing)
- Minimizing costs is priority

**Choose Double-Close When:**
- Assignment fee exceeds $15,000-$20,000
- You want fee privacy
- Significant spread might cause deal friction
- Seller or buyer might object to visible profit
- You have transactional funding readily available

### Double-Close Funding Costs

If using transactional funding for double-closes:
- **Fee**: 1-2.5% of funded amount
- **Minimum fee**: Often $1,500-$2,500
- **Additional**: Wire fees, document fees

**Example**: Funding $100,000 for same-day double close:
- Funding fee (2%): $2,000
- Wire fees: $100
- **Total funding cost: $2,100**

This adds to your closing costs, further reducing net profit.

## Pre-Paid Items and Prorations

Prorations ensure each party pays their fair share of ongoing expenses. Understanding these prevents closing surprises.

### Common Prorated Items

**Property Taxes**
- Calculate seller's share from last payment through closing date
- Buyer credits seller if taxes are prepaid; seller credits buyer if taxes are due
- Formula: (Annual tax ÷ 365) × Days seller owned in current period

**Example**: Annual taxes $3,650, closing March 15, taxes due December 31
- Daily rate: $10
- Days seller owes (Jan 1 - Mar 15): 74 days
- Seller credit to buyer: $740

**HOA Dues**
- Similar calculation to taxes
- Check if dues are prepaid monthly, quarterly, or annually
- Include any outstanding assessments

**Utilities**
- Typically handled outside closing
- Seller responsible through closing date
- Final meter readings at closing

**Rent (Income Properties)**
- If tenant has prepaid rent, seller credits buyer
- Security deposits transfer to buyer
- Important for rental property wholesales

### Proration Calculation Methods

**365-Day Method**: Annual amount ÷ 365 × days
**30-Day Month Method**: Annual amount ÷ 12 ÷ 30 × days
**Actual Days Method**: Uses actual days in each month

Most title companies use the 365-day method. Confirm with your title company which method they use for consistency.

## Examples

### Example 1: Standard Assignment Transaction

**Property**: 3BR/2BA in Atlanta, GA
**Contract Price with Seller (A-B)**: $85,000
**Assignment to Buyer (B-C)**: $95,000
**Assignment Fee**: $10,000

**Seller Closing Costs:**
- Title insurance: $510
- Transfer tax ($1/1,000): $85
- Settlement fee (half): $200
- Prorated taxes: $380
- **Seller Total: $1,175**

**Buyer Closing Costs:**
- Settlement fee (half): $200
- Recording: $75
- Title search: $175
- Wire fee: $35
- **Buyer Total: $485**

**Your Costs (Wholesaler):**
- Assignment processing: $150
- **Your Total: $150**

**Your Net Profit: $10,000 - $150 = $9,850**

### Example 2: Double-Close in High Transfer Tax State

**Property**: Townhome in Philadelphia, PA
**A-B Purchase Price**: $65,000
**B-C Sale Price**: $90,000
**Gross Spread**: $25,000

**A-B Transaction (You as Buyer):**
- Title insurance: $420
- Settlement fee: $350
- Recording: $100
- Transfer tax ($15/1,000 × $65,000): $975
- **A-B Total: $1,845**

**B-C Transaction (You as Seller):**
- Title insurance: $540
- Settlement fee: $350
- Recording: $75
- Transfer tax ($15/1,000 × $90,000): $1,350
- **B-C Total: $2,315**

**Transactional Funding (if needed):**
- Funding $65,000 at 2%: $1,300
- Wire fees: $100
- **Funding Total: $1,400**

**Total Double-Close Costs: $5,560**
**Net Profit: $25,000 - $5,560 = $19,440**

Note: An assignment would have netted approximately $24,700—a $5,260 difference. The double-close only made sense here for fee privacy.

### Example 3: Negotiated Closing Cost Structure

**Property**: Distressed property, motivated seller
**Initial Offer**: $72,000
**Seller Counter**: $78,000
**Estimated Closing Costs for Seller**: $1,800

**Negotiation**: 
"I understand you need $78,000. Here's what I can do: I'll pay $76,500, but I'll cover all your closing costs. You'll net the same $76,500 - $1,800 = $74,700 you'd get at $78,000 anyway, but you won't have to worry about any closing surprises."

**Result**: Seller accepts. Your effective purchase price: $76,500 + $1,800 = $78,300—only $300 more than seller's counter, but seller feels they got their price.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Not Accounting for Closing Costs in MAO
**The Problem**: Calculating MAO without subtracting closing costs leads to overpaying
**The Solution**: Always deduct 2-3% for closing costs in your MAO formula
**Example**: ARV $200K × 70% - $30K repairs - **$5K closing costs** = $105K MAO

### Mistake 2: Forgetting Transfer Taxes in High-Tax States
**The Problem**: A $2,000+ surprise at closing devastates your margin
**The Solution**: Research your state's transfer tax before making offers; include in all calculations

### Mistake 3: Not Getting Title Company Quotes Upfront
**The Problem**: Generic estimates can be off by 20-40%
**The Solution**: Build relationships with 2-3 title companies; get quotes before making offers

### Mistake 4: Choosing Double-Close for Small Spreads
**The Problem**: Double-close costs can consume most of a $5,000-$10,000 spread
**The Solution**: Reserve double-closing for spreads over $15,000-$20,000

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Proration Timing
**The Problem**: Closing at the wrong time costs money unnecessarily
**The Solution**: When possible, close right after property tax payments are due from seller

### Mistake 6: Not Explaining Closing Costs to Sellers
**The Problem**: Sellers feel ambushed at closing; deals fall apart
**The Solution**: Always present "net to seller" numbers and explain costs upfront

### Mistake 7: Assuming Standard Closing Cost Allocation
**The Problem**: Assuming buyer or seller pays certain costs without confirming local custom
**The Solution**: Verify with your title company who customarily pays each fee in your market

### Mistake 8: Using Retail Closing Cost Estimates
**The Problem**: Traditional real estate closing cost guides (3-6%) don't apply to cash wholesale deals
**The Solution**: Use wholesale-specific estimates (1-3% for cash transactions)

### Mistake 9: Not Negotiating Title Company Fees
**The Problem**: Paying full price when volume discounts are available
**The Solution**: Negotiate settlement fees, especially if you bring consistent volume

### Mistake 10: Forgetting Transactional Funding Costs
**The Problem**: Calculating double-close profit without including funding costs
**The Solution**: Add 2-3% funding cost to double-close calculations when you need capital
