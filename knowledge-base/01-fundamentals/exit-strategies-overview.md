# Complete Guide to Real Estate Exit Strategies - From Wholesale Assignments to BRRRR

## Quick Reference

- **Exit strategy determines everything**: Your offer price, contract terms, buyer pool, and profit potential all depend on how you plan to exit the deal
- **Wholesale assignment** is the fastest, lowest-risk strategy but limits your profit to your assignment fee and requires disclosure in most markets
- **Double closing** protects your profit margin from disclosure and works when spreads are large or sellers prohibit assignments
- **Novation agreements** replace you entirely with the end buyer, eliminating double-close costs while hiding your fee
- **Subject-to transactions** let you acquire property while keeping the seller's existing mortgage in place—powerful but requires careful execution
- **Creative deals** (seller financing, lease options) open doors when traditional financing fails or sellers need specific terms
- **Fix and flip** generates the highest per-deal profits but requires capital, renovation expertise, and market timing
- **BRRRR strategy** builds long-term wealth through forced appreciation, refinancing, and portfolio growth
- **Match exit strategy to property condition**: Distressed properties suit wholesaling/flipping; turnkey properties suit rentals
- **Always have a backup exit**: The best wholesalers prepare multiple exit strategies before making offers

## Understanding Exit Strategies: Your Path to Profit

Your exit strategy is simply how you plan to make money from a deal. It's the most critical decision you'll make on every transaction because it dictates your offer price, negotiation approach, timeline, and ultimately your profit.

Think of exit strategies as different lanes on a highway—each leads to the same destination (profit), but some are faster, some have more traffic, and some require a bigger vehicle. Choosing the wrong lane can cost you thousands or kill a deal entirely.

## Wholesale Assignment

### What It Is
A wholesale assignment transfers your contractual rights to purchase a property to another buyer. You never actually buy the property—you sell your contract position for an assignment fee.

### How It Works
1. You sign a purchase agreement with the seller at $100,000
2. You find a cash buyer willing to pay $120,000
3. You assign your contract to the buyer for a $20,000 assignment fee
4. The buyer closes directly with the seller
5. You receive your $20,000 at closing

### Pros
- **Minimal capital required**: You only need earnest money ($500-$5,000 typically)
- **No financing needed**: You're not actually purchasing the property
- **Fast turnaround**: Deals can close in 14-30 days
- **Lower risk**: If you can't find a buyer, you can often back out via inspection contingency
- **Simple process**: One closing, minimal paperwork

### Cons
- **Fee disclosure**: Your profit becomes visible to all parties in most states
- **Contract restrictions**: Some sellers or their agents add "no assignment" clauses
- **Buyer limitations**: Only works with cash buyers or buyers whose lenders allow assignments
- **Profit ceiling**: Large spreads become difficult when everyone sees your fee
- **Reputation concerns**: Large visible fees can create relationship issues

### When to Use
- Your spread is under $15,000-$20,000
- The seller doesn't object to assignment
- You have a strong cash buyer network
- You want the fastest, simplest exit
- You're building experience and relationships

## Double Close (Simultaneous Close)

### What It Is
A double close involves two separate transactions: you buy from the seller (A-B transaction), then immediately sell to your end buyer (B-C transaction). You actually take title, even if only for minutes or hours.

### How It Works
1. You contract with seller at $100,000 (A-B)
2. You contract with buyer at $135,000 (B-C)
3. Your buyer's funds finance both closings through transactional funding
4. First closing: You buy from seller for $100,000
5. Second closing: You sell to buyer for $135,000
6. Net profit: $35,000 minus closing costs and transactional funding fees

### Pros
- **Hidden profit**: Neither party sees your full margin
- **No assignment restrictions**: You're completing a full purchase
- **Larger spreads possible**: Buyers and sellers don't know each other's numbers
- **Works with financed buyers**: End buyers can use conventional loans (with proper seasoning)
- **Professional appearance**: You look like a legitimate investor, not a middleman

### Cons
- **Higher costs**: Two sets of closing costs plus transactional funding fees (1-2% of purchase price)
- **More complexity**: Coordinating two closings requires experience
- **Title company cooperation**: Not all title companies handle double closes
- **Timing risk**: Both closings must happen in sequence
- **Capital or funding required**: You need transactional funding if your buyer's funds don't arrive first

### When to Use
- Your spread exceeds $20,000-$25,000
- The contract prohibits assignment
- You want to protect your profit from disclosure
- You're building credibility for larger deals
- The end buyer needs conventional financing

### Cost Breakdown
Typical double-close costs on a $100,000 purchase:
- Transactional funding: $1,000-$2,500 (1-2.5%)
- Additional closing costs: $800-$1,500
- Total additional expense: $1,800-$4,000

## Novation Agreements

### What It Is
A novation completely substitutes your end buyer into your original contract with the seller. Unlike assignment (where you transfer rights), novation cancels your contract and creates a new one between seller and buyer.

### How It Works
1. You contract with seller at $100,000
2. You find buyer willing to pay $125,000
3. All three parties sign a novation agreement
4. Your original contract is terminated
5. A new contract forms between seller and buyer at $125,000
6. You receive your $25,000 fee at closing (or before)

### Pros
- **Complete privacy**: Your fee isn't disclosed on the HUD or settlement statement
- **No double-close costs**: Only one transaction occurs
- **Clean title chain**: No questions about your brief ownership
- **Works with any buyer**: Financed or cash buyers work equally well
- **Eliminates "middle-man" appearance**: You're officially out of the deal

### Cons
- **Seller involvement required**: Seller must agree to the novation
- **Complex explanation**: Many sellers (and even agents) don't understand novation
- **Legal nuances**: Requires proper documentation to be enforceable
- **Loss of control**: Once novated, you have no contractual position
- **Less common**: Fewer title companies and attorneys are familiar with the process

### When to Use
- You want assignment simplicity without fee disclosure
- The seller is cooperative and educated
- Your buyer uses conventional financing
- You're working with an attorney who understands novation
- The spread makes double-close costs prohibitive

## Subject-To Transactions

### What It Is
"Subject-to" means purchasing a property subject to the existing financing. The seller's mortgage stays in place, but ownership transfers to you. You make the payments, but the loan remains in the seller's name.

### How It Works
1. Seller owes $150,000 on mortgage with $1,200/month payment
2. Property worth $200,000
3. You take title subject to the existing mortgage
4. You pay seller $5,000 for their equity (negotiable)
5. You make the $1,200 monthly payments
6. You own the property with $50,000+ in equity

### Pros
- **Minimal cash required**: Often just a few thousand dollars to seller
- **No qualifying**: You don't need to qualify for financing
- **Better terms**: Existing mortgages often have lower rates than current market
- **Instant equity**: You acquire the spread between loan balance and value
- **Cash flow potential**: Lower payments often mean better rental returns

### Cons
- **Due-on-sale risk**: Lenders can technically call the loan due upon transfer
- **Seller liability**: The seller remains legally responsible for the mortgage
- **Trust issues**: Sellers must trust you to make payments
- **Insurance complexity**: Requires proper insurance structuring
- **Legal gray area**: Some states have restrictions or disclosure requirements

### When to Use
- Seller has significant equity but can't sell traditionally
- Existing loan terms are better than current market
- Seller facing foreclosure needs immediate relief
- You want to build a rental portfolio without qualifying for loans
- Property needs no repairs and can immediately generate income

### Critical Considerations
- Always use an attorney experienced in subject-to transactions
- Get proper authorization to communicate with the lender
- Set up payment systems that protect both parties
- Maintain adequate insurance with proper endorsements
- Have a clear exit plan (refinance, sell, or wrap)

## Seller Financing and Creative Deals

### What It Is
Seller financing occurs when the seller acts as the bank, allowing you to make payments directly to them instead of obtaining traditional financing.

### Common Structures

**Straight Seller Financing**
- Seller owns property free and clear
- You make down payment plus monthly payments to seller
- Seller holds a note secured by the property

**Wrap-Around Mortgage**
- Seller has existing mortgage
- You make payments to seller at higher amount
- Seller continues paying their underlying mortgage
- Your payment "wraps around" their existing loan

**Lease Option**
- You lease with option to purchase
- Portion of rent credits toward purchase price
- You control property without ownership
- Option fee typically applied to purchase

### Pros
- **Flexible terms**: Negotiate interest rate, term, and payment structure
- **No bank qualifying**: Seller makes approval decision
- **Creative structuring**: Balloon payments, interest-only periods, graduated payments
- **Tax benefits for seller**: Installment sale can defer capital gains
- **Lower closing costs**: No bank fees, reduced title requirements

### Cons
- **Higher interest rates**: Sellers often want above-market returns
- **Due-on-sale risk**: Wraps carry same risks as subject-to
- **Seller financial risk**: If seller has money problems, your property could be affected
- **Balloon payment pressure**: Many deals require refinancing within 3-5 years
- **Complexity**: Requires understanding of promissory notes, deeds of trust, and payment structures

### When to Use
- Seller owns free and clear and wants monthly income
- Property doesn't qualify for traditional financing
- You can't qualify for bank loans
- Both parties want tax advantages
- Market conditions make traditional financing unappealing

## Fix and Flip

### What It Is
Buy a distressed property, renovate it, and sell at retail price for profit.

### The Fix and Flip Formula
**ARV × 70% - Repair Costs = Maximum Purchase Price**

Example:
- ARV (After Repair Value): $300,000
- 70% of ARV: $210,000
- Repair Costs: $50,000
- Maximum Purchase Price: $160,000
- Expected Profit: $300,000 - $160,000 - $50,000 - $30,000 (holding/selling costs) = $60,000

### Pros
- **Highest profit potential**: $30,000-$100,000+ per deal possible
- **Forced appreciation**: You create value through renovation
- **Market independence**: Profit comes from discount, not market appreciation
- **Scalable**: Systems and teams allow multiple simultaneous projects
- **Retail buyer pool**: Larger buyer pool than investor-only deals

### Cons
- **Capital intensive**: Need funds for purchase, renovation, and holding
- **Time consuming**: 3-6+ months from purchase to sale
- **Expertise required**: Renovation management, contractor relationships, market knowledge
- **Market risk**: Markets can shift during renovation period
- **High carrying costs**: Mortgage payments, insurance, utilities, taxes during renovation

### When to Use
- You have capital and/or hard money relationships
- Property needs significant renovation
- ARV supports strong profit margin after all costs
- You have contractor relationships and project management skills
- Market supports retail sales at projected ARV

## Buy and Hold (Rental Properties)

### What It Is
Purchase property to hold long-term, generating income through rent and building wealth through appreciation and loan paydown.

### Key Metrics
- **Cash-on-Cash Return**: Annual cash flow ÷ Total cash invested (target: 8-12%+)
- **Cap Rate**: NOI ÷ Purchase price (market dependent)
- **1% Rule**: Monthly rent should equal 1% of purchase price (increasingly rare)
- **50% Rule**: Assume 50% of rent goes to expenses (excluding mortgage)

### Pros
- **Passive income**: Monthly cash flow after stabilization
- **Appreciation**: Long-term property value increases
- **Loan paydown**: Tenants pay your mortgage
- **Tax benefits**: Depreciation, expense deductions, 1031 exchanges
- **Wealth building**: Creates net worth and generational wealth

### Cons
- **Management burden**: Tenants, maintenance, vacancies
- **Illiquidity**: Can't quickly access equity
- **Capital requirements**: Down payments, reserves, repairs
- **Market risk**: Rents and values can decline
- **Liability exposure**: Landlord responsibilities and legal risks

### When to Use
- Property generates positive cash flow
- Strong rental market with low vacancy
- You want long-term wealth over quick profits
- Property is in good condition or needs minimal repairs
- You have systems for property management

## BRRRR Strategy

### What It Is
Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat—a strategy for building a rental portfolio by recycling capital.

### How It Works
1. **Buy**: Purchase distressed property below market ($80,000)
2. **Rehab**: Renovate to maximize value ($30,000 in repairs)
3. **Rent**: Place quality tenant at market rent ($1,400/month)
4. **Refinance**: Cash-out refinance at new appraised value ($150,000 × 75% = $112,500 loan)
5. **Repeat**: Use refinance proceeds ($112,500 - $110,000 total cost = $2,500 back) for next deal

### The Math That Makes It Work
- Purchase price: $80,000
- Renovation: $30,000
- Total investment: $110,000
- After-repair value: $150,000
- Cash-out refinance (75% LTV): $112,500
- Cash recovered: $112,500 - $110,000 = $2,500
- Result: You own a $150,000 rental with infinite return on your $0 remaining investment

### Pros
- **Capital recycling**: Recover most or all of your investment
- **Forced appreciation**: Create equity through renovation
- **Infinite returns**: When done right, no money left in deal
- **Portfolio acceleration**: Scale faster than traditional buy-and-hold
- **Multiple profit centers**: Equity, cash flow, appreciation, and loan paydown

### Cons
- **Execution complexity**: Must execute purchase, rehab, rental, and financing correctly
- **Appraisal risk**: If appraisal comes in low, capital stays trapped
- **Market timing**: Refinance rates and values must align
- **Seasoning requirements**: Many lenders require 6-12 months before refinance
- **Cash flow impact**: Higher loan amounts reduce monthly cash flow

### When to Use
- You want to build a rental portfolio quickly
- You have renovation and property management capabilities
- Properties exist with significant value-add potential
- Refinance rates support cash flow after higher loan
- You plan to hold long-term

## How Exit Strategy Affects Your Offer Price

Your maximum offer price changes dramatically based on exit strategy. The same property might warrant completely different offers:

### Comparative Analysis: $200,000 ARV Property Needing $30,000 Repairs

**Wholesale Assignment Exit**
- End buyer needs: 70% ARV margin
- End buyer max: $200,000 × 70% - $30,000 = $110,000
- Your assignment fee target: $10,000
- Your maximum offer: $100,000

**Fix and Flip Exit**
- Your margin requirement: 70% ARV
- Your maximum offer: $200,000 × 70% - $30,000 = $110,000
- Expected profit (if purchased at $100,000): $40,000

**Buy and Hold Exit (assuming $1,600/month rent potential)**
- Value based on income: Varies by cap rate requirements
- May pay up to 80-85% ARV for strong cash flow
- Maximum offer: $130,000-$140,000

**Key Insight**: The same property might receive a $100,000 offer for wholesaling, $110,000 for flipping, or $135,000 for rental—demonstrating why understanding exit strategies makes you a better negotiator.

## Matching Properties to the Right Exit Strategy

### Distressed Properties (60-70% ARV)
**Best exits**: Wholesale, Fix and Flip
**Why**: Deep discount required for rehab profit; retail buyers avoid

### Light Cosmetic Needs (80-85% ARV)
**Best exits**: BRRRR, Fix and Flip, Novation
**Why**: Lower renovation risk; faster turnaround; value-add still possible

### Turnkey Condition (90%+ ARV)
**Best exits**: Subject-To, Seller Financing, Buy and Hold
**Why**: No rehab margin; creative terms create value instead of discount

### Unique or Luxury Properties
**Best exits**: Novation, Double Close, Retail Listing
**Why**: Limited investor buyer pool; retail marketing maximizes value

### Pre-Foreclosure with Equity
**Best exits**: Subject-To, Wholesale, Short-Term Flip
**Why**: Motivated seller; time pressure; existing financing leverage

## Examples

### Example 1: Urban Wholesale Assignment

**Situation**: You find a 3BR/2BA house in a B-class neighborhood
- Seller asking: $165,000
- Property condition: Dated but functional
- ARV: $220,000
- Repairs needed: $25,000

**Analysis**:
- Investor end-buyer calculation: $220,000 × 70% - $25,000 = $129,000
- Your target assignment fee: $12,000
- Maximum offer to seller: $117,000

**Execution**:
- You negotiate purchase at $120,000
- Find cash buyer at $133,000
- Assignment fee: $13,000
- Timeline: Contract to close in 21 days
- Your cost: $1,000 earnest money (returned) + $500 marketing = $500 total expense

### Example 2: Subject-To Acquisition for Rental

**Situation**: Seller inherited property and lives out of state
- Property value: $185,000
- Existing mortgage: $142,000 at 3.5% ($850/month P&I)
- Seller just wants out, owes back taxes of $3,200
- Market rent: $1,600/month

**Your Offer**:
- Take property subject-to existing mortgage
- Pay seller $3,000 at closing
- You pay the $3,200 in back taxes
- Total acquisition cost: $6,200 + closing costs (~$1,500) = $7,700

**Cash Flow Analysis**:
- Monthly rent: $1,600
- Mortgage payment: $850
- Taxes/Insurance/Maintenance (estimated): $400
- Monthly cash flow: $350
- Annual cash flow: $4,200
- Cash-on-cash return: $4,200 ÷ $7,700 = 54.5%
- Equity captured: $185,000 - $142,000 = $43,000

### Example 3: BRRRR Execution

**Situation**: Foreclosure in transitioning neighborhood
- Purchase price: $95,000
- Renovation budget: $40,000
- After-repair value: $190,000
- Expected rent: $1,700/month

**Execution Timeline**:
- Month 1: Close purchase (private lender at 12%)
- Months 2-4: Complete renovation
- Month 4: Place tenant at $1,700/month
- Month 10: Cash-out refinance (75% LTV)

**Financial Outcome**:
- Total investment: $135,000 + $10,000 (holding costs) = $145,000
- Appraised value: $190,000
- Cash-out refinance: $190,000 × 75% = $142,500
- Cash remaining in deal: $145,000 - $142,500 = $2,500
- Monthly cash flow (after new mortgage): $250
- Equity position: $47,500
- Return on remaining investment: $3,000 ÷ $2,500 = 120% annually

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Choosing Exit Strategy After Contract
**The mistake**: Contracting a property without knowing your exit
**Why it fails**: Your offer price depends on exit strategy; wrong price kills deals
**Solution**: Determine primary and backup exit strategies before making any offer

### 2. Assigning Deals with Large Spreads
**The mistake**: Using assignment when your fee exceeds $15,000-$20,000
**Why it fails**: Visible large fees damage relationships and cause closing problems
**Solution**: Double close or novate when spreads exceed comfort thresholds

### 3. Ignoring Due-on-Sale Clause Risk
**The mistake**: Taking subject-to without understanding or addressing the risk
**Why it fails**: Lender could call loan due, creating financial crisis
**Solution**: Understand the realistic risk level, use land trusts where appropriate, have backup plans

### 4. Underestimating Fix and Flip Costs
**The mistake**: Using 70% ARV rule without including ALL costs
**Why it fails**: Holding costs, financing costs, and selling costs eat profit
**Solution**: Build comprehensive proforma including: closing costs (buy and sell), holding costs, financing costs, and contingency

### 5. Over-Leveraging in BRRRR
**The mistake**: Maximizing cash-out refinance without considering cash flow
**Why it fails**: Higher loan means lower cash flow; market shift creates negative cash flow
**Solution**: Target 75% LTV maximum; ensure minimum $200/month cash flow post-refinance

### 6. Failing to Match Property to Strategy
**The mistake**: Trying to wholesale a turnkey property or BRRRR a gut rehab
**Why it fails**: Wrong strategy means wrong buyer pool or impossible margins
**Solution**: Analyze property condition and let it guide strategy selection

### 7. Not Having Backup Exit Strategies
**The mistake**: Planning only one exit path
**Why it fails**: Market changes, buyers fall through, repairs exceed budget
**Solution**: Every deal should have primary exit plus two backup strategies

### 8. Misunderstanding Novation Requirements
**The mistake**: Treating novation like assignment without proper documentation
**Why it fails**: Improper novation could void the transaction or create liability
**Solution**: Work with attorney experienced in novation; use proper three-party agreements

### 9. Ignoring Seasoning Requirements
**The mistake**: Planning BRRRR refinance without confirming lender seasoning rules
**Why it fails**: Many lenders require 6-12 months ownership before refinancing
**Solution**: Establish refinance lender relationship before purchasing; understand their requirements

### 10. Forgetting Exit Strategy in Contract Terms
**The mistake**: Using standard contracts without customization for your exit
**Why it fails**: Assignment requires assignable contracts; subject-to requires specific clauses
**Solution**: Use contracts designed for your exit strategy; consult with real estate attorney
