# Maximum Allowable Offer (MAO) Formula - The Complete Calculation Guide

## Quick Reference

- **Core MAO Formula**: MAO = (ARV × Investor Discount %) - Repair Costs - Wholesale Fee
- **Standard 70% Rule**: MAO = (ARV × 0.70) - Repairs - Your Fee (used for fix-and-flip buyers)
- **The 70% accounts for**: Buyer's profit (15%), holding costs (8%), selling costs (7%)
- **Always calculate from the buyer's perspective**: Your MAO must leave room for their profit
- **Different buyer types require different formulas**: Flippers, landlords, and BRRRR investors each have unique requirements
- **Build in buffers**: Add 5-10% contingency for unknown repair costs and market fluctuations
- **Quick mental math**: ARV × 0.65 gives you a conservative starting point before detailed analysis
- **Never skip repair verification**: Underestimated repairs destroy more deals than any other factor
- **Your wholesale fee comes LAST**: Calculate what buyers can pay first, then subtract your profit
- **Market conditions matter**: Hot markets may allow 75%, distressed markets may require 60-65%

## Understanding the Maximum Allowable Offer

The Maximum Allowable Offer represents the highest price you can pay for a property while still leaving room for your wholesale fee and your end buyer's required profit. Calculate this number incorrectly, and you'll either overpay (losing money or killing deals) or underoffer so aggressively that you never get contracts accepted.

Your MAO is not a guess. It's a mathematical calculation based on what your cash buyers need to make their investment profitable. When you understand the components and can adjust for different buyer types, you transform from someone throwing out random offers into a professional who can justify every number with confidence.

## The Core MAO Formula Explained

### The Standard Formula

```
MAO = (ARV × Investor Discount Percentage) - Repair Costs - Wholesale Fee
```

Let's break down each component:

**ARV (After Repair Value)**: The fair market value of the property after all renovations are complete. This is what the property would sell for in retail condition to a regular homebuyer.

**Investor Discount Percentage**: The percentage of ARV that investors are willing to pay. This accounts for their profit margin, holding costs, and selling costs. Typically ranges from 65-75% depending on buyer type and market conditions.

**Repair Costs**: The total cost to renovate the property to ARV condition. This includes materials, labor, permits, and contingency.

**Wholesale Fee**: Your profit for finding and assigning the deal. Typically $5,000-$20,000+ depending on deal size and market.

### The Classic 70% Rule

The most commonly used formula in wholesaling is:

```
MAO = (ARV × 0.70) - Repairs - Wholesale Fee
```

The 70% factor is not arbitrary. Here's what it accounts for:

| Cost Category | Typical Percentage |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Investor Profit | 15% |
| Holding Costs | 8% |
| Selling Costs (commissions, closing) | 7% |
| **Total Investor Needs** | **30%** |

This leaves 70% of ARV for acquisition plus repairs.

### Practical Example: Standard 70% Calculation

**Property Details:**
- ARV: $250,000
- Repair Estimate: $35,000
- Your Target Wholesale Fee: $10,000

**Calculation:**
```
MAO = ($250,000 × 0.70) - $35,000 - $10,000
MAO = $175,000 - $35,000 - $10,000
MAO = $130,000
```

You can offer up to $130,000 for this property. At this price, your buyer pays $140,000 (your price plus assignment fee), invests $35,000 in repairs, and is all-in at $175,000 on a property worth $250,000—giving them $75,000 gross profit margin.

## Working Backward from Buyer's Required Returns

Professional wholesalers don't just memorize formulas—they understand the math from their buyer's perspective. This allows you to adjust calculations for specific buyers and justify your prices during negotiations.

### The Buyer's Profit Equation

```
Buyer's Profit = ARV - Purchase Price - Repairs - Holding Costs - Selling Costs
```

Working backward to find what they can pay:

```
Maximum Purchase Price = ARV - Desired Profit - Repairs - Holding Costs - Selling Costs
```

### Detailed Example: Buyer's Perspective

**Property:** 3BR/2BA single-family home
- ARV: $300,000
- Repairs Needed: $40,000
- Estimated Rehab Time: 4 months

**Buyer's Cost Breakdown:**
- Desired Profit: $45,000 (15% of ARV)
- Holding Costs: $2,400/month × 4 months = $9,600
  - (Hard money interest, insurance, utilities, taxes)
- Selling Costs: $21,000 (7% of ARV)
  - (Agent commission, closing costs, staging)

**Calculation:**
```
Maximum Purchase = $300,000 - $45,000 - $40,000 - $9,600 - $21,000
Maximum Purchase = $184,400
```

**Your MAO (subtracting wholesale fee):**
```
MAO = $184,400 - $12,000 (your fee)
MAO = $172,400
```

Notice this is slightly more than the 70% rule would give you ($300,000 × 0.70 - $40,000 - $12,000 = $158,000). The detailed calculation revealed additional room because this is a shorter rehab with lower holding costs.

## MAO Formulas for Different Buyer Types

### Fix-and-Flip Investors

**Profile:** Buy, renovate, sell quickly for profit
**Primary Concern:** Profit margin and timeline
**Typical ARV Percentage:** 70-75%

**Formula:**
```
MAO = (ARV × 0.70) - Repairs - Wholesale Fee
```

**Key Considerations:**
- Flippers need 15-25% profit margins
- Factor in 3-6 month holding period
- Account for 6-8% selling costs
- Tighter margins in competitive markets

**Example:**
- ARV: $400,000
- Repairs: $60,000
- Wholesale Fee: $15,000

```
MAO = ($400,000 × 0.70) - $60,000 - $15,000
MAO = $280,000 - $60,000 - $15,000
MAO = $205,000
```

### Buy-and-Hold Landlords

**Profile:** Purchase for long-term rental income
**Primary Concern:** Cash flow, cap rate, appreciation
**Typical ARV Percentage:** 75-85% (may pay more for cash flow)

Landlords evaluate deals differently. They care less about immediate equity and more about:
- Monthly cash flow
- Cash-on-cash return
- Long-term appreciation
- Quality of tenant pool

**Cash Flow-Based Formula:**
```
MAO = (Annual NOI ÷ Required Cap Rate) - Repairs - Wholesale Fee
```

**Alternative Approach - Working from Rent:**
```
Step 1: Determine market rent
Step 2: Calculate NOI (rent × 12 - expenses)
Step 3: Divide by buyer's required cap rate
Step 4: Subtract repairs and your fee
```

**Example:**
- Property can rent for $2,000/month after repairs
- Annual expenses (taxes, insurance, maintenance, vacancy): $6,000
- NOI = ($2,000 × 12) - $6,000 = $18,000
- Buyer requires 8% cap rate
- Repairs: $25,000
- Wholesale Fee: $8,000

```
Property Value at 8% Cap = $18,000 ÷ 0.08 = $225,000
MAO = $225,000 - $25,000 - $8,000
MAO = $192,000
```

**Pro Tip:** Many landlords will pay more than flippers for the same property because they're buying for cash flow, not quick resale profit. Build a strong landlord buyer list.

### BRRRR Investors

**Profile:** Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat
**Primary Concern:** Being "all-in" at 70-75% of ARV to refinance out capital
**Typical ARV Percentage:** 70-75% (must hit refinance threshold)

BRRRR investors need to pull all their cash back out through refinancing. Most lenders refinance at 70-75% of appraised value, so the investor's total investment (purchase + repairs) must be at or below this threshold.

**BRRRR Formula:**
```
MAO = (ARV × 0.75) - Repairs - Closing Costs - Wholesale Fee
```

**Example:**
- ARV: $220,000
- Repairs: $30,000
- Closing Costs (both purchases): $6,000
- Wholesale Fee: $10,000

```
Maximum All-In = $220,000 × 0.75 = $165,000
MAO = $165,000 - $30,000 - $6,000 - $10,000
MAO = $119,000
```

At this price, the buyer is all-in at $165,000 ($119,000 + $10,000 fee + $30,000 repairs + $6,000 closing costs), which equals exactly 75% of ARV—allowing full capital recovery on refinance.

## Buffer and Contingency Considerations

### Why Buffers Matter

Every experienced wholesaler has a story about "the deal that should have worked" but didn't because of unforeseen costs. Build buffers into your calculations to protect both yourself and your buyers.

### Types of Buffers

**Repair Contingency (5-15% of repair estimate):**
- 5% for newer homes with visible issues only
- 10% standard for most properties
- 15% for older homes, unknown conditions, or limited access during inspection

**Market Fluctuation Buffer (2-5% of ARV):**
- Accounts for market shifts during rehab period
- More important in uncertain markets
- Less critical in strong seller's markets

**Timeline Buffer:**
- Add 1-2 months to expected holding period
- Permits, weather, contractor delays happen

### Conservative MAO Formula with Buffers

```
MAO = (ARV × 0.70) - (Repairs × 1.10) - Wholesale Fee - (ARV × 0.03)
```

**Example with Buffers:**
- ARV: $280,000
- Initial Repair Estimate: $45,000
- Wholesale Fee: $12,000

```
MAO = ($280,000 × 0.70) - ($45,000 × 1.10) - $12,000 - ($280,000 × 0.03)
MAO = $196,000 - $49,500 - $12,000 - $8,400
MAO = $126,100
```

Without buffers, MAO would have been $139,000. The $12,900 difference protects everyone in the deal.

## Quick Mental Math Shortcuts

When you're on the phone with a seller or walking through a property, you need quick calculations. Here are shortcuts that work:

### The 65% Quick Calculation

For fast mental math with built-in safety margin:

```
ARV × 0.65 = Starting Point
Subtract obvious repairs for quick MAO
```

**Example:** 
- Seller says comparable homes sell for $200,000
- You see the property needs a full kitchen and roof
- Quick math: $200,000 × 0.65 = $130,000
- Subtract $40,000 for kitchen/roof = $90,000 rough MAO

### The Per-Square-Foot Method

Know your market's price per square foot for:
- Retail (ARV) condition: e.g., $150/sqft
- Investor purchase price: e.g., $100/sqft

**Example:**
- 1,500 sqft home
- Market ARV: $150/sqft = $225,000 ARV
- Investor price: $100/sqft = $150,000 target all-in
- If repairs are $30,000, MAO = $120,000 - your fee

### The Rule of 10s

For every $100,000 in ARV using the 70% rule:
- $70,000 available for purchase + repairs
- Typical repairs ($20-30K): $40-50K purchase price per $100K ARV

**Quick Reference:**
| ARV | 70% Available | Light Rehab MAO | Heavy Rehab MAO |
|-----|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| $150,000 | $105,000 | $80,000 | $55,000 |
| $200,000 | $140,000 | $105,000 | $70,000 |
| $250,000 | $175,000 | $130,000 | $85,000 |
| $300,000 | $210,000 | $155,000 | $100,000 |

*(Assumes $10K wholesale fee, $15K light rehab, $50K heavy rehab)*

## Examples

### Example 1: Standard Single-Family Flip

**Scenario:** Distressed 3BR/2BA in suburban neighborhood

- ARV: $325,000 (based on 3 recent comparable sales)
- Repairs: $55,000 (full renovation minus roof and HVAC)
- Target Wholesale Fee: $15,000
- Buyer Type: Fix-and-flip investor

**Calculation:**
```
MAO = ($325,000 × 0.70) - $55,000 - $15,000
MAO = $227,500 - $55,000 - $15,000
MAO = $157,500
```

**Offer Strategy:** Start at $140,000, negotiate up to $157,500 maximum.

### Example 2: Rental Property for Landlord

**Scenario:** Duplex in B-class neighborhood

- Each unit rents for $1,100/month = $2,200 total
- Annual Operating Expenses: $8,400
- NOI: $26,400 - $8,400 = $18,000
- Buyer requires 7% cap rate
- Repairs: $20,000 (cosmetic updates)
- Wholesale Fee: $10,000

**Calculation:**
```
Value at 7% Cap = $18,000 ÷ 0.07 = $257,143
MAO = $257,143 - $20,000 - $10,000
MAO = $227,143
```

**Comparison to 70% Rule:**
If ARV were $280,000 (retail value):
```
70% Rule MAO = ($280,000 × 0.70) - $20,000 - $10,000 = $166,000
```

The landlord calculation allows $61,143 MORE because this buyer is purchasing for cash flow, not resale profit. Know your buyer type.

### Example 3: BRRRR Deal Analysis

**Scenario:** Small single-family perfect for BRRRR strategy

- ARV: $180,000
- Repairs: $25,000
- Closing Costs (both transactions): $5,000
- Wholesale Fee: $8,000
- Buyer needs 75% LTV refinance to pull out capital

**Calculation:**
```
Maximum All-In for Refinance = $180,000 × 0.75 = $135,000
MAO = $135,000 - $25,000 - $5,000 - $8,000
MAO = $97,000
```

**Verification:**
- Buyer pays: $97,000 + $8,000 = $105,000
- Plus repairs: $105,000 + $25,000 = $130,000
- Plus closing costs: $130,000 + $5,000 = $135,000
- Refinance at 75% LTV: $180,000 × 0.75 = $135,000 ✓

Buyer recovers 100% of capital on refinance. Deal works.

### Example 4: Tight Market Adjustment

**Scenario:** Competitive market where buyers accept thinner margins

- ARV: $450,000
- Repairs: $40,000
- Your buyers will pay up to 78% of ARV in this market
- Wholesale Fee: $18,000

**Adjusted Calculation:**
```
MAO = ($450,000 × 0.78) - $40,000 - $18,000
MAO = $351,000 - $40,000 - $18,000
MAO = $293,000
```

**Standard 70% would be:**
```
MAO = ($450,000 × 0.70) - $40,000 - $18,000 = $257,000
```

Knowing your market and buyers allows you to offer $36,000 more—dramatically improving your contract acceptance rate.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Overestimating ARV
**Why It's Dangerous:** Every dollar of inflated ARV becomes $0.70 of inflated MAO. A $20,000 ARV error means a $14,000 MAO error.
**How to Avoid:** Use only sold comps from the last 90 days within 0.5 miles. Adjust for condition, size, and features. When in doubt, use the lower value.

### Mistake 2: Underestimating Repairs
**Why It's Dangerous:** The most common deal-killer. Buyers walk away or renegotiate when inspections reveal additional work.
**How to Avoid:** Get contractor estimates when possible. Add 10-15% contingency. Never trust seller's repair estimates.

### Mistake 3: Forgetting Holding Costs
**Why It's Dangerous:** Six months of hard money payments, insurance, utilities, and taxes can easily add $15,000-25,000 to a deal.
**How to Avoid:** Build holding costs into your detailed analysis. The 70% rule includes an estimate, but verify it works for each deal.

### Mistake 4: Applying One Percentage to All Buyers
**Why It's Dangerous:** You'll either leave money on the table with landlords or scare away flippers with unrealistic prices.
**How to Avoid:** Know your buyer's strategy. Ask what percentage or returns they require. Customize calculations.

### Mistake 5: Forgetting Your Wholesale Fee
**Why It's Dangerous:** You calculate what the buyer can pay, make that your offer, and leave yourself zero profit.
**How to Avoid:** Always calculate: Buyer's Maximum Price minus Your Fee equals Your MAO.

### Mistake 6: Using Outdated Comps
**Why It's Dangerous:** Markets shift. Six-month-old comps in a cooling market mean inflated ARV.
**How to Avoid:** Prioritize comps under 90 days. Adjust for market trends. Check days on market for current listings.

### Mistake 7: Ignoring Market-Specific Percentages
**Why It's Dangerous:** The 70% rule works in many markets but fails in expensive coastal markets or rural areas.
**How to Avoid:** Ask local buyers what they need. In expensive markets, buyers may need 65% or less. In hot markets, they may accept 75-80%.

### Mistake 8: Not Verifying with Actual Buyers
**Why It's Dangerous:** Your spreadsheet says it's a deal, but no one buys it.
**How to Avoid:** Before making offers, run numbers past 2-3 active buyers. Their feedback validates your calculations.

### Mistake 9: Double-Counting Costs
**Why It's Dangerous:** Adding buyer's closing costs when they're already included in the percentage creates artificially low MAO.
**How to Avoid:** Understand what the 70% (or whatever percentage) includes. Don't subtract costs that are already factored in.

### Mistake 10: Analysis Paralysis
**Why It's Dangerous:** Spending hours perfecting calculations while other wholesalers make offers and get contracts.
**How to Avoid:** Use quick mental math for initial screening. Only do detailed analysis on viable deals. Speed matters.
