## Understanding Quick Estimation Methods

As a wholesaler, you need to quickly estimate repair costs to determine whether a deal is worth pursuing. You're not expected to have contractor-level precision, but you must be accurate enough to avoid costly mistakes that kill your deals or your reputation.

### The Per-Square-Foot Method

The fastest way to estimate repairs is using cost-per-square-foot multipliers based on the property's overall condition. This gives you a ballpark figure in seconds.

**Light Rehab ($10-20 per square foot)**
Properties needing only cosmetic updates fall into this category. Think fresh paint throughout, new flooring, updated light fixtures, minor landscaping, and perhaps some appliance replacements. A 1,500 sqft house needing light rehab typically costs $15,000-30,000.

**Medium Rehab ($20-35 per square foot)**
This includes everything in a light rehab plus kitchen cabinet refacing or replacement, bathroom updates, HVAC servicing or replacement, and minor electrical or plumbing updates. A 1,500 sqft medium rehab runs $30,000-52,500.

**Heavy Rehab ($35-60 per square foot)**
Heavy rehabs involve significant work: roof replacement, major electrical upgrades, plumbing overhauls, foundation repairs, window replacement, and complete kitchen and bathroom renovations. Budget $52,500-90,000 for a 1,500 sqft property.

**Gut Rehab ($60-100+ per square foot)**
A gut rehab means taking the property down to studs and rebuilding. This includes all new mechanical systems, structural modifications, and premium finishes. A 1,500 sqft gut rehab costs $90,000-150,000 or more.

### The Line-Item Method

For more accurate estimates, calculate each repair category individually and total them. This takes longer but provides a defensible number you can present to cash buyers with confidence.

## Signs of Hidden Damage That Increase Costs

Experienced wholesalers know that visible damage often hints at invisible problems. Learn to spot these red flags.

### Water Damage Indicators
- Stains on ceilings (roof leaks, bathroom above)
- Bubbling or peeling paint (moisture intrusion)
- Musty odors (mold behind walls)
- Warped flooring near bathrooms or kitchens
- Soft spots in subfloor
- Exterior staining below windows

### Foundation Warning Signs
- Diagonal cracks from window/door corners
- Doors and windows that stick or won't close
- Sloping floors (use a marble test)
- Gaps between walls and ceiling
- Stair-step cracks in brick exterior
- Cracks wider than 1/4 inch

### Electrical Red Flags
- Two-prong outlets throughout (no grounding)
- Flickering lights
- Warm outlet covers
- Federal Pacific or Zinsco panels (immediate replacement needed)
- Knob-and-tube wiring visible in attic/basement
- Multiple extension cords indicating insufficient outlets

### Plumbing Concerns
- Low water pressure
- Slow drains throughout
- Galvanized or polybutylene pipes (replacement recommended)
- Water stains in basement or crawlspace
- Gurgling sounds when flushing
- Sewage smell from drains

### Structural Issues
- Sagging rooflines
- Bouncy floors
- Cracks in exterior brick
- Leaning chimneys
- Bowing basement walls
- Previous fire damage (check for smoke staining in attic)

## How to Estimate Without Entering the Property

Sometimes you can't get inside. Here's how to create reasonable estimates from the exterior and public information.

### Drive-By Estimation Process

1. **Assess roof condition** - Look for sagging, missing shingles, moss growth, and gutter condition
2. **Evaluate siding and paint** - Note peeling, rot, holes, or damage
3. **Count windows and doors** - Estimate replacement costs based on condition
4. **Check foundation** - Walk the perimeter looking for visible cracks
5. **Note landscaping needs** - Overgrown yards often indicate interior neglect
6. **Photograph everything** - Document all visible issues

### Using Public Information

- **Tax records**: Find square footage, bedroom/bathroom count, year built
- **Google Street View**: Compare current condition to historical images
- **Zillow/Redfin**: View previous listing photos if available
- **Permit history**: Check for unpermitted work that may need correction
- **Flood zone maps**: Determine flood risk and insurance requirements

### Exterior-Only Estimation Formula

When you can only see the exterior, use this approach:

1. Estimate visible exterior repairs
2. Assume interior needs match exterior condition
3. Use the per-square-foot method for interior
4. Add 25% additional contingency for unknown interior issues

**Example**: A 1,500 sqft home with poor exterior condition
- Visible exterior repairs: $15,000
- Interior estimate (medium-heavy @ $40/sqft): $60,000
- Standard contingency (15%): $11,250
- Unknown interior contingency (25%): $18,750
- **Total exterior-only estimate: $105,000**

## Building Relationships with Contractors

Your contractor network is one of your most valuable business assets. Here's how to build it.

### Finding Good Contractors

- Attend local REIA meetings and ask for referrals
- Ask successful flippers who they use
- Check with property managers for maintenance contacts
- Review permits for active renovation projects and contact those contractors
- Use referrals from title companies and real estate agents

### Approaching Contractors for Estimates

When you're new, be honest about your situation:

*"I'm a real estate wholesaler. I find distressed properties and sell them to investors who will do the rehab. I need accurate repair estimates to price my deals correctly. If you help me with estimates, I'll recommend you to every buyer I work with. Would you be interested in helping me evaluate a property?"*

### Building Long-Term Relationships

- Always respect their time—consolidate property visits
- Provide detailed information before the walkthrough
- Never waste their time on properties you won't pursue
- Refer business to them actively
- Pay promptly if you ever hire them directly
- Send thank-you notes and small gifts during holidays

### Creating Win-Win Arrangements

Offer value in exchange for their expertise:
- Buyer referrals (this is huge for contractors)
- Lead sheets when you find properties outside your buy box
- Marketing their services in your buyer communications
- Honest feedback from your buyers about their work

## Contingency Planning and Safety Margins

Never present a repair estimate without contingency built in. Unknown issues will appear on nearly every project.

### Standard Contingency Guidelines

- **Clean, well-maintained properties**: 10% contingency
- **Average distressed properties**: 15% contingency
- **Heavily distressed or vacant properties**: 20% contingency
- **Properties you couldn't fully inspect**: 25% contingency

### Where to Add Contingency

Add contingency to your total, not individual line items. This keeps your scope of work clean while protecting the overall budget.

**Example Calculation**:
- Base repair estimate: $45,000
- Contingency (15%): $6,750
- **Presented repair estimate: $51,750**

### Communicating Contingency to Buyers

Be transparent with your cash buyers:

*"My repair estimate is $52,000, which includes a 15% contingency for unknowns. The base scope is $45,000. Given the property's condition, I'd recommend maintaining that buffer."*

## Regional Cost Variations

Repair costs vary dramatically by location. A $50,000 rehab in Memphis might cost $85,000 in Seattle.

### High-Cost Markets (30-50% above national average)
- San Francisco Bay Area
- New York City metro
- Los Angeles
- Seattle
- Boston
- Washington D.C.

### Moderate-Cost Markets (near national average)
- Dallas-Fort Worth
- Phoenix
- Atlanta
- Denver
- Nashville
- Charlotte

### Lower-Cost Markets (20-40% below national average)
- Memphis
- Cleveland
- Indianapolis
- Kansas City
- St. Louis
- Birmingham

### Adjusting Your Estimates

Research local costs by:
- Getting contractor quotes in your specific market
- Checking HomeAdvisor or Thumbtack for local pricing
- Asking experienced local investors
- Reviewing completed rehab budgets from local flippers

## Material Cost Fluctuations

Material prices have become increasingly volatile. Account for this in your estimates.

### Volatile Materials to Watch
- Lumber (can fluctuate 50%+ annually)
- Copper (affects plumbing and electrical costs)
- Appliances (supply chain dependent)
- Roofing materials
- Concrete

### Strategies for Material Volatility

1. **Check current pricing monthly** - Adjust your per-square-foot multipliers as needed
2. **Add material contingency** - Include 5-10% additional buffer during volatile periods
3. **Specify materials in scope** - Note specific products so buyers understand grade level
4. **Date your estimates** - Always include the date; estimates expire in 30-60 days

## Examples

### Example 1: Light Rehab Ranch Home

**Property**: 1,200 sqft, 3BR/1BA ranch built 1975
**Condition**: Dated but well-maintained, original owner

### Example 3: Exterior-Only Estimate

**Property**: 1,400 sqft, 3BR/2BA, built 1980
**Situation**: Occupied, couldn't gain interior access

**Visible Exterior Issues**:
- Roof appears original (40+ years): $10,000
- Siding damage and paint peeling: $6,000
- 3 broken windows visible: $1,500
- Overgrown landscaping: $1,500

1,400 sqft @ $45/sqft = $63,000

**Combined Subtotal**: $84,000
**Standard Contingency (15%)**: $12,600
**Exterior-Only Contingency (25%)**: $21,000
**Total Conservative Estimate**: $117,600 (round to $120,000)

## Common Mistakes

1. **Using national averages in expensive markets** - Always localize your estimates. A bathroom remodel in San Francisco costs twice what it does in Cleveland.

2. **Forgetting permit costs** - Major work requires permits. Budget $2,000-5,000 for permit fees on heavy rehabs.

3. **Underestimating kitchens and bathrooms** - These always cost more than expected. Use the higher end of ranges.

4. **Ignoring holding costs** - Longer rehabs mean more carrying costs for your buyer. Factor this into your deal analysis.

5. **Not inspecting attic and crawlspace** - These areas hide expensive problems: mold, pest damage, insulation issues, and structural concerns.

6. **Assuming systems work because they're present** - That HVAC unit may be original equipment from 1985. Age matters.

7. **Missing code compliance issues** - Older homes often need electrical and safety upgrades to meet current code.

8. **Presenting estimates without documentation** - Always provide a written scope. Verbal estimates invite disputes.

9. **Using one contractor's quote as gospel** - Get multiple perspectives. Prices vary significantly between contractors.

10. **Forgetting the dumpster** - Debris removal costs $500-2,000+ depending on project size. Include it in every estimate.
