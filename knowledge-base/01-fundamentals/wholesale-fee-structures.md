# Wholesale Fee Structures: How to Price Your Assignment Fees for Maximum Profit

Your assignment fee represents the value you create by solving problems, finding opportunities, and connecting motivated sellers with qualified buyers. Price too low, and you leave thousands on the table. Price too high, and deals fall apart. This guide gives you the frameworks, formulas, and market intelligence to price every deal with confidence.

## Quick Reference

- **Low cost-of-living markets**: Typical wholesale fees range from $5,000 to $15,000
- **Medium cost-of-living markets**: Typical wholesale fees range from $10,000 to $25,000
- **High cost-of-living markets**: Typical wholesale fees range from $20,000 to $75,000+
- **Fee percentage rule**: Your fee should generally be 5-15% of the total equity spread
- **Disclosure requirements**: At least 12 states have specific fee disclosure rules—know yours
- **The quality-fee relationship**: Better deals support higher fees; thin deals require thin margins
- **Partner splits**: Document everything in writing before marketing the deal
- **Volume vs. margin**: Choose your strategy based on your market conditions and business goals
- **Fee justification**: Always be ready to demonstrate the value you bring to buyers
- **Maximum fee guideline**: Your fee should never exceed what leaves adequate profit for your buyer

## Understanding Wholesale Assignment Fees

Your wholesale assignment fee is the profit you earn for assigning your rights in a purchase contract to an end buyer. You're not selling a property—you're selling your contractual position and the opportunity you created.

The fee represents compensation for:
- Marketing costs to find the deal
- Time spent negotiating with sellers
- Due diligence and property analysis
- Buyer acquisition and relationship building
- Transaction coordination and problem-solving

Understanding this value proposition is essential because you'll need to communicate it clearly to buyers, especially when charging premium fees on exceptional deals.

## Typical Wholesale Fee Ranges by Market

Your market's cost of living directly impacts acceptable fee ranges. Property values, investor expectations, and deal economics vary significantly across different markets.

### Low Cost-of-Living Markets ($5,000-$15,000)

Markets like Detroit, Cleveland, Memphis, Birmingham, Indianapolis, and most rural areas fall into this category.

**Typical deal profile:**
- ARV (After Repair Value): $80,000-$150,000
- Purchase price: $30,000-$70,000
- Renovation costs: $15,000-$40,000
- Assignment fees: $5,000-$15,000

In these markets, a $10,000 assignment fee is considered solid, and $15,000 represents an excellent deal. Fees below $5,000 are common but may not justify your time and marketing investment.

**Market-specific considerations:**
- Buyers expect lower acquisition costs
- Deal volume can offset smaller individual fees
- Competition is often intense for the best deals
- Rental arbitrage deals may support slightly higher fees

### Medium Cost-of-Living Markets ($10,000-$25,000)

Markets like Phoenix, Atlanta, Dallas, Nashville, Charlotte, and Tampa represent the middle tier.

**Typical deal profile:**
- ARV: $200,000-$400,000
- Purchase price: $100,000-$200,000
- Renovation costs: $40,000-$80,000
- Assignment fees: $10,000-$25,000

The sweet spot in these markets is $15,000-$20,000. Fees of $25,000+ are achievable on exceptional deals with strong equity positions.

**Market-specific considerations:**
- Larger buyer pools with varying experience levels
- More room to negotiate on both acquisition and disposition
- Property type diversity creates fee variation
- Suburban properties often support higher fees than urban infill

### High Cost-of-Living Markets ($20,000-$75,000+)

Markets like San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, Boston, and Miami command premium fees.

**Typical deal profile:**
- ARV: $500,000-$2,000,000+
- Purchase price: $300,000-$1,000,000+
- Renovation costs: $100,000-$300,000+
- Assignment fees: $20,000-$75,000+

In coastal and luxury markets, fees of $50,000 are common, and $100,000+ assignments happen regularly on exceptional deals.

**Market-specific considerations:**
- Buyer expectations are sophisticated
- Larger absolute dollars justify intensive due diligence
- Longer transaction timelines are common
- Zoning and entitlement opportunities can dramatically increase fee potential

## Percentage-Based vs. Flat Fee Approaches

Wholesalers use two primary methods to calculate assignment fees. Each has distinct advantages depending on deal characteristics and your business model.

### Percentage-Based Pricing

This approach calculates your fee as a percentage of the total equity spread—the difference between your contract price and the maximum a buyer should pay.

**Common percentage ranges:**
- Standard deals: 5-10% of equity spread
- Exceptional deals: 10-15% of equity spread
- Thin deals: 3-5% of equity spread

**Formula:**
```
Equity Spread = ARV - Repair Costs - Buyer's Desired Profit - Your Contract Price
Your Fee = Equity Spread × Target Percentage
```

**Example calculation:**
- ARV: $300,000
- Repair costs: $50,000
- Buyer's desired profit (20%): $60,000
- Maximum buyer pays: $190,000
- Your contract price: $150,000
- Equity spread: $40,000
- Your fee at 10%: $4,000
- Your fee at 25%: $10,000 (more realistic target)

**When to use percentage-based pricing:**
- You're establishing baseline expectations
- Deals vary significantly in size
- You want consistent profit margins across your portfolio
- You're analyzing deals quickly during acquisition

### Flat Fee Pricing

This approach sets a predetermined fee regardless of deal size, simplifying your pricing and buyer communications.

**Common flat fee tiers:**
- Entry level: $5,000
- Standard: $10,000-$15,000
- Premium: $20,000-$25,000
- Exceptional: $30,000+

**When to use flat fee pricing:**
- You work primarily in one market with consistent deal sizes
- You want simplified pricing conversations with buyers
- Your deals fall within a narrow value range
- You're building volume through predictable pricing

### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

Most experienced wholesalers use a hybrid approach: establish minimum flat fee thresholds while allowing upside based on deal quality.

**Example framework:**
- Minimum acceptable fee: $10,000
- Target fee on standard deals: $15,000
- Maximum fee: limited only by deal quality

This protects your downside while capturing upside on exceptional opportunities.

## How Deal Size Affects Acceptable Fee Percentages

The relationship between deal size and acceptable fee percentages is inverse. Larger deals typically support lower percentage fees but higher absolute dollar amounts.

### Small Deals (Under $100,000 Contract Price)

- Acceptable fee percentage: 15-25% of equity spread
- Typical absolute fee: $5,000-$12,000
- Buyer psychology: Expects lower absolute dollars, accepts higher percentages

**Example:**
- Contract price: $60,000
- ARV: $120,000
- Repairs: $25,000
- Buyer pays: $75,000
- Your fee: $15,000 (25% of $60,000 spread, or 20% fee-to-contract ratio)

### Medium Deals ($100,000-$300,000 Contract Price)

- Acceptable fee percentage: 10-15% of equity spread
- Typical absolute fee: $10,000-$30,000
- Buyer psychology: Balances percentage and absolute fee considerations

**Example:**
- Contract price: $180,000
- ARV: $320,000
- Repairs: $60,000
- Buyer pays: $200,000
- Your fee: $20,000 (10% of $200,000 spread relative to ARV)

### Large Deals ($300,000+ Contract Price)

- Acceptable fee percentage: 5-10% of equity spread
- Typical absolute fee: $25,000-$75,000+
- Buyer psychology: Focuses on absolute dollars and deal viability

**Example:**
- Contract price: $450,000
- ARV: $750,000
- Repairs: $120,000
- Buyer pays: $500,000
- Your fee: $50,000 (absolute value matters more than percentage)

### The Dollar-for-Dollar Threshold

Sophisticated buyers care less about percentages and more about whether their all-in cost allows adequate profit. A $50,000 fee on a deal yielding $150,000 buyer profit is easier to justify than a $20,000 fee on a deal yielding $40,000 buyer profit.

## When You Can Charge $5K vs. $20K vs. $50K+ Fees

Your fee ceiling depends on multiple factors working together. Understanding these dynamics helps you maximize profit on every deal.

### $5,000 Fee Scenarios

**When this fee level makes sense:**
- Thin equity deals with minimal margin
- Highly competitive acquisitions where you accepted lower seller discount
- Building relationships with new buyers
- Volume-based strategy where speed matters more than margin
- Markets with sub-$100,000 ARV properties
- Properties requiring significant buyer effort (title issues, access challenges)

**Example scenario:**
You lock up a property at $65,000 with an ARV of $110,000 and $20,000 in repairs. The maximum buyer price is approximately $72,000-$77,000. A $5,000-$7,000 fee works here because it leaves adequate margin for the buyer while compensating you for your effort.

### $20,000 Fee Scenarios

**When this fee level makes sense:**
- Solid equity positions (30%+ discount from ARV)
- Clean deals without complications
- Properties in desirable areas with multiple interested buyers
- Proven buyer relationships with track record
- Medium COL markets with ARV in $250,000-$400,000 range
- Deals with clear value-add opportunities

**Example scenario:**
You secure a contract at $140,000 on a property with $320,000 ARV needing $50,000 in repairs. Your buyer pays $160,000, leaving them with approximately $70,000-$80,000 gross profit potential. Your $20,000 fee is easily justified.

### $50,000+ Fee Scenarios

**When this fee level is achievable:**
- Exceptional equity (40%+ discount from ARV)
- High COL markets with $500,000+ ARV properties
- Off-market commercial or multi-family opportunities
- Unique deals with limited buyer competition
- Properties with entitlement or development upside
- Established reputation allowing premium pricing
- Deals sourced through exclusive channels

**Example scenario:**
You lock up a distressed duplex in Seattle at $520,000. ARV is $900,000 with $150,000 renovation budget. Your buyer pays $570,000, positions the property for $900,000+ sale or refinance, and captures $180,000+ profit potential. Your $50,000 fee represents fair compensation for this exceptional opportunity.

## Fee Disclosure Requirements by State

Real estate regulations vary significantly by state. Some states require explicit assignment fee disclosure, while others have minimal requirements.

### States with Specific Disclosure Requirements

**Strict disclosure states:**
- **Ohio**: Must disclose assignment fee to all parties
- **Illinois**: Assignment fee disclosure often required in contracts
- **Texas**: Real Estate License Act may require disclosure if acting as intermediary
- **Florida**: Disclosure required in many circumstances
- **Pennsylvania**: Recent regulations require fee transparency

**States with licensing implications:**
- California, New York, and New Jersey have aggressive enforcement against unlicensed activity, making disclosure documentation essential for legal protection

### General Disclosure Best Practices

Regardless of state requirements:

1. **Use clear contract language** stating you may assign the contract for profit
2. **Include assignment language in every purchase agreement**
3. **Document your position** as a principal buyer, not an agent
4. **Keep records** of all fee discussions and agreements
5. **Consult local real estate attorneys** for state-specific guidance

### What to Include in Contracts

Standard protective language:
```
"Buyer reserves the right to assign this contract to a third party 
for consideration. Buyer is purchasing as a principal and not acting 
as an agent or broker for any party."
```

This language establishes your position and protects against claims of undisclosed agency relationships.

## How to Justify Your Fee to Buyers

Sophisticated buyers evaluate deals based on their profit potential, not your fee amount. Here's how to communicate value effectively.

### The Value Proposition Framework

When a buyer questions your fee, respond with:

**1. Deal sourcing investment:**
"I invested $X in marketing, spent Y hours negotiating, and evaluated Z properties to find this opportunity."

**2. Opportunity cost comparison:**
"Finding this deal yourself would require comparable marketing spend plus your time. My fee is your acquisition cost."

**3. Deal quality metrics:**
"This property offers X% below market value, with Y% projected ROI on your investment."

**4. Speed and convenience:**
"You receive a fully negotiated, contract-ready deal without lead generation, seller negotiations, or qualification work."

### The Numbers Conversation

Frame every fee discussion around buyer profit:

"I understand you're evaluating my $20,000 fee. Let me walk you through the numbers: Your all-in cost is $180,000. ARV is conservatively $310,000. Repairs are estimated at $55,000. You're looking at $75,000+ gross profit. My fee represents approximately 27% of your profit—essentially your customer acquisition cost for this opportunity."

### Building Fee Acceptance Over Time

Consistent buyers care about deal quality, not fee amounts. Deliver profitable deals, and fee resistance disappears. Your first deals with a new buyer may require fee flexibility. Your tenth deal commands premium pricing.

## The Relationship Between Deal Quality and Fee Size

Deal quality is the single biggest determinant of achievable fees. Here's how quality factors translate to pricing power.

### Quality Factors That Support Premium Fees

**Deep equity position:**
- 35%+ discount from ARV supports $20,000+ fees
- 45%+ discount from ARV supports $35,000+ fees
- 50%+ discount from ARV supports $50,000+ fees

**Clean deal characteristics:**
- Clear title with no liens or encumbrances
- Vacant properties with immediate access
- Cooperative sellers with signed contracts
- Realistic repair estimates from walkthrough
- No inspection contingencies or extended timelines

**Desirability factors:**
- Properties in high-demand neighborhoods
- School districts that command premium values
- Characteristics matching current buyer demand
- Multiple exit strategies (flip, rental, Airbnb)

### Quality Factors That Limit Fees

**Deal complications:**
- Title issues requiring resolution
- Occupied properties with tenant complications
- Seller timeline restrictions
- Access limitations preventing proper inspection
- Unusual property characteristics limiting buyer pool

**Market position challenges:**
- Properties in declining neighborhoods
- Limited buyer interest in property type
- Extended days on market for comparable sales
- Oversupply in immediate area

## Splitting Fees with Partners and JV Deals

Partnership deals require clear fee allocation agreements before any marketing begins.

### Common Split Structures

**50/50 splits (most common):**
- One partner sources the deal, one partner closes
- Both partners contribute equally
- Default split for undefined arrangements

**60/40 or 70/30 splits:**
- Weighted toward the partner contributing more value
- Deal finder receives larger share in most cases
- Closing partner may receive premium if bringing buyer

**Flat fee referral:**
- Fixed amount ($1,000-$5,000) for deal referral
- Closing partner keeps remaining profit
- Simpler but may undervalue exceptional deals

### Partnership Agreement Essentials

Document these elements before marketing any JV deal:

1. **Fee split percentage or amounts**
2. **Who pays marketing costs if deal doesn't close**
3. **Decision authority on pricing and buyer selection**
4. **Timeline for payment after closing**
5. **What happens if deal falls through at various stages**
6. **Non-circumvention provisions protecting both parties**

### Example Partnership Calculation

**Scenario:** You find a deal and partner with an experienced wholesaler who has the buyer network.

- Assignment fee collected: $25,000
- Agreed split: 60/40 (you as deal finder / partner as closer)
- Your portion: $15,000
- Partner portion: $10,000
- Marketing costs: Partner covers, deducted before split

**Alternative structure:** 
- Your flat referral fee: $5,000
- Partner keeps: $20,000
- Partner handles all marketing and closing costs

The right structure depends on your relationship, deal quality, and each party's contributions.

## Volume vs. Margin Strategy Trade-offs

Your pricing strategy reflects broader business model decisions. Understanding these trade-offs helps you build a sustainable wholesaling operation.

### High Volume, Lower Margin Strategy

**Characteristics:**
- Target fees: $5,000-$10,000
- Monthly deal target: 4-10 deals
- Buyer relationships: Wide network, price-sensitive buyers
- Marketing approach: High lead volume, aggressive follow-up

**Advantages:**
- Consistent cash flow
- More transaction experience
- Larger buyer database
- Reduced dependence on any single deal
- Lower deal risk (smaller fees mean deals close easier)

**Challenges:**
- Higher marketing costs relative to profit
- More operational complexity
- Team required for scaling
- Tighter margins leave less room for error

**Best for:**
- Experienced operators with systems
- Markets with abundant deal flow
- Wholesalers building buyer networks
- Those prioritizing consistency over maximum profit

### High Margin, Lower Volume Strategy

**Characteristics:**
- Target fees: $20,000-$50,000+
- Monthly deal target: 1-3 deals
- Buyer relationships: Select group of qualified, active investors
- Marketing approach: Selective lead pursuit, patient negotiation

**Advantages:**
- Higher profit per hour invested
- Lower operational overhead
- More time for due diligence
- Sustainable without large team
- Better deals attract premium buyers

**Challenges:**
- Income variability month to month
- Longer time between paydays
- Requires excellent deal analysis skills
- Higher opportunity cost when deals fall through

**Best for:**
- Solo operators or small teams
- High COL markets with larger deal sizes
- Experienced negotiators who can create deep equity
- Those valuing lifestyle flexibility over scale

### Hybrid Strategies

Most successful wholesalers blend both approaches:
- Accept smaller fees on quick-turn deals
- Hold out for premium fees on exceptional opportunities
- Maintain minimum fee threshold regardless of deal size
- Adjust strategy based on current pipeline and cash needs

## Examples

### Example 1: Low COL Market Deal Analysis

**Market:** Indianapolis, Indiana
**Property:** 3BR/2BA ranch, built 1965
**Situation:** Inherited property, estate sale

- ARV: $165,000
- Contract price: $85,000
- Estimated repairs: $35,000
- 70% ARV formula max: $115,500 - $35,000 = $80,500

**Fee calculation:**
- Buyer purchase price: $97,000
- Your fee: $12,000
- Buyer all-in: $132,000
- Buyer profit potential: $33,000

**Result:** $12,000 fee represents solid performance in this market. The buyer's 25% ROI on their investment makes this an easy close.

### Example 2: High COL Market Premium Deal

**Market:** San Diego, California
**Property:** 4BR/3BA single family, dated 1990s construction
**Situation:** Divorce, motivated sellers needing fast close

- ARV: $875,000
- Contract price: $560,000
- Estimated repairs: $95,000
- 70% ARV formula max: $612,500 - $95,000 = $517,500

**Fee calculation:**
- Buyer purchase price: $610,000
- Your fee: $50,000
- Buyer all-in: $705,000
- Buyer profit potential: $170,000

**Result:** $50,000 fee is well-supported. Your buyer captures significant profit, and your fee represents reasonable acquisition cost for this caliber opportunity.

### Example 3: JV Partnership Deal

**Scenario:** Your acquisition partner found a deal but lacks buyer relationships.

- ARV: $280,000
- Contract price: $145,000
- Repairs: $45,000
- Buyer price: $170,000
- Total assignment fee: $25,000

**Partnership structure:**
- Deal finder: 55% ($13,750)
- Disposition partner (you): 45% ($11,250)
- Marketing costs: Split equally from total fee before distribution

**Result:** Both partners profit while contributing their core strengths.

### Example 4: Volume Strategy Monthly Performance

**Monthly target:** 5 deals at $8,000 average fee

- Deal 1: $6,500 (tight margins, fast close)
- Deal 2: $9,000 (standard deal)
- Deal 3: $5,500 (buyer negotiated down)
- Deal 4: $12,000 (excellent equity position)
- Deal 5: $7,000 (average deal)

**Monthly gross:** $40,000
**Marketing spend:** $8,000
**Net before overhead:** $32,000

This volume approach provides consistent income while building buyer relationships and market presence.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Pricing Based on Your Needs, Not Deal Value
Your rent payment doesn't determine your fee. Fees must align with deal economics. Charging $25,000 on a thin deal because you need the money guarantees the deal falls apart.

### 2. Failing to Know Your Market's Norms
A $5,000 fee that's standard in Cleveland signals desperation in Los Angeles. Research comparable wholesale fees in your specific market before pricing deals.

### 3. Disclosing Fees Unnecessarily to Sellers
Unless legally required, your fee is between you and your buyer. Sellers don't need to know your profit margin, and disclosing it often creates problems.

### 4. Not Having Fee Discussions Before Contracts
Establish fee expectations with buyers before sending deals. Surprise fees cause deals to fall apart at closing.

### 5. Leaving Money on Table on Exceptional Deals
If your buyer is thrilled and closes instantly at your asking price, you probably priced too low. Great deals deserve great fees.

### 6. Ignoring State-Specific Disclosure Requirements
Regulatory violations can result in fines, lawsuits, and criminal charges. Know your state's requirements cold.

### 7. Splitting Fees Without Written Agreements
Verbal partnership agreements create lawsuits. Document every JV deal in writing before marketing.

### 8. Focusing Only on Fee Amount, Not Close Rate
A $15,000 fee that closes beats a $25,000 fee that falls apart. Consider close probability when pricing.

### 9. Not Adjusting Fees Based on Buyer Relationships
New buyers deserve pricing that encourages first deals. Established buyers pay market rates. Price strategically.

### 10. Comparing Fees Across Incomparable Markets
Social media celebrates $50,000 fees without context. That fee is exceptional in Ohio and standard in California. Focus on your market.
