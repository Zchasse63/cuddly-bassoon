# Comparable Sales Analysis: The Complete Guide to Finding and Using Comps in Real Estate Wholesaling

## Quick Reference

- **Valid comps must be**: Sold (closed), similar in characteristics, nearby in location, and recent in time frame
- **Ideal comp radius**: Urban 0.25-0.5 miles, suburban 0.5-1 mile, rural 1-3 miles
- **Time frame priority**: 0-90 days (best), 91-180 days (acceptable), 180+ days (use with caution and adjustments)
- **The 4 critical matching factors**: Property type, square footage (±20%), bed/bath count, and condition
- **Standard adjustments**: $20-50 per square foot, $3,000-7,000 per bedroom, $2,500-5,000 per bathroom, $5,000-15,000 for garage
- **Active listings represent ceiling pricing**—never use them as primary ARV indicators
- **Always bracket your subject property** between at least one higher and one lower comp
- **Minimum 3 comps required**; 5-6 comps provide optimal confidence
- **Pending sales indicate current market direction** better than closed sales from months ago
- **Your comp narrative must tell a story** that convinces buyers and lenders of your ARV

## What Makes a Valid Comparable Sale

A comparable sale—commonly called a "comp"—is a recently sold property that shares enough characteristics with your subject property to help determine market value. In wholesaling, your ability to find valid comps directly determines whether you calculate an accurate After Repair Value (ARV) and, ultimately, whether your deal is profitable.

### The Four Pillars of Valid Comps

**1. Sold Status**
Only closed transactions count as true comps. A property must have completed the sale with a recorded deed and final sale price. Asking prices, list prices, and even accepted offers don't qualify as primary comps because they don't represent what a buyer actually paid.

**2. Similarity**
The comp must share fundamental characteristics with your subject property. A 1,200 square foot ranch cannot be compared to a 3,000 square foot colonial. The more similar the comp, the fewer adjustments you need—and fewer adjustments mean higher confidence in your ARV.

**3. Proximity**
Location drives value more than any other factor. A comp three blocks away in the same subdivision carries far more weight than a comp two miles away in a different neighborhood, even if the distant property matches perfectly on paper.

**4. Recency**
Markets move constantly. A sale from six months ago may not reflect today's market conditions, especially in rapidly appreciating or depreciating areas. The more recent the sale, the more accurately it reflects current market value.

## The Comp Selection Hierarchy

Not all comps carry equal weight. Understanding the hierarchy helps you prioritize which comps to use and how much confidence to place in your ARV.

### Tier 1: Ideal Comps (Highest Confidence)
- Sold within 30 days
- Same subdivision or immediate neighborhood
- Within 100 square feet of subject
- Same bedroom and bathroom count
- Same condition level (renovated to renovated, dated to dated)
- Same lot size (±10%)

When you find a Tier 1 comp, it essentially sets your ARV with minimal need for adjustments.

### Tier 2: Strong Comps (High Confidence)
- Sold within 60 days
- Within 0.5 miles (urban) or 1 mile (suburban)
- Within 200 square feet of subject
- ±1 bedroom or bathroom
- Similar condition requiring minor adjustments
- Comparable lot characteristics

Most of your comps will fall into Tier 2. These require adjustments but provide reliable data.

### Tier 3: Acceptable Comps (Moderate Confidence)
- Sold within 90-180 days
- Within 1 mile (urban) or 2 miles (suburban)
- Within 300-400 square feet of subject
- ±1-2 bedrooms or bathrooms
- Different condition levels requiring significant adjustments

Use Tier 3 comps when better options don't exist, but apply adjustments carefully and conservatively.

### Tier 4: Last Resort Comps (Use With Caution)
- Sold 180+ days ago
- Beyond typical radius requirements
- Significant size differences requiring large adjustments
- Different property types (only when necessary)

Tier 4 comps should only supplement stronger comps, never stand alone. When using them, clearly document why no better options exist.

## Geographic Radius Guidelines by Market Type

Your search radius depends entirely on market density. What works in Chicago won't work in rural Kansas.

### Urban Markets (Dense Metro Areas)
**Primary radius: 0.25-0.5 miles**
**Extended radius: 0.5-0.75 miles**

In urban markets, micro-locations matter intensely. One block can represent a significant value difference. Prioritize staying within the same:
- Census tract
- School district
- Neighborhood boundaries (often defined by major streets)
- Zoning classification

### Suburban Markets (Typical Residential Areas)
**Primary radius: 0.5-1 mile**
**Extended radius: 1-1.5 miles**

Suburban comps should ideally come from the same:
- Subdivision or development
- School attendance zone
- HOA (if applicable)
- Price tier neighborhood

### Rural Markets (Low-Density Areas)
**Primary radius: 1-3 miles**
**Extended radius: 3-5 miles**

Rural comp analysis often requires broader searches due to limited sales volume. Prioritize:
- Same township or county area
- Similar lot sizes (acreage varies significantly in rural areas)
- Similar property types (ranch properties versus agricultural)
- Comparable road access and utilities

### When to Expand Your Radius

Expand your radius only when:
- Fewer than 3 comps exist within primary radius
- The subject property has unique features requiring specialized comps
- A neighboring area has more recent, comparable sales
- Local market expertise confirms the expanded area as equivalent

Document why you expanded and how the areas compare.

## Time Frame Requirements and Adjustments

### The Time Hierarchy

**0-90 Days: Gold Standard**
These comps require no time adjustments in stable markets. They represent current market conditions and provide the highest confidence.

**91-180 Days: Acceptable with Consideration**
Apply time adjustments if the market has moved. In appreciating markets (common in most areas), add 0.25-0.5% per month. In declining markets, subtract the same.

Example: A comp sold 5 months ago at $285,000 in a market appreciating at 0.5% monthly:
$285,000 × (0.5% × 5 months) = $285,000 × 2.5% = $7,125 upward adjustment
Adjusted comp value: $292,125

**180+ Days: Use with Extreme Caution**
Comps older than six months should only supplement newer data. Market conditions, buyer preferences, and economic factors change significantly over this timeframe. Always:
- Apply market trend adjustments
- Weight these comps lower than recent sales
- Document why newer comps weren't available
- Verify no major market shifts occurred since the sale

### Market Appreciation/Depreciation Adjustments

To determine your local appreciation rate:
1. Pull median sale prices for the past 12 months
2. Calculate the percentage change month-over-month
3. Average the monthly changes for your adjustment rate

Most stable markets see 3-6% annual appreciation (0.25-0.5% monthly). Hot markets can exceed 1% monthly, while declining markets may show negative rates.

## Property Characteristic Matching Priorities

When you can't find perfect matches, prioritize characteristics in this order:

### Priority 1: Property Type
Never compare a single-family home to a duplex, or a townhouse to a detached home. Property types attract different buyers at different price points.

### Priority 2: Location Quality
A smaller home in a better location often outsells a larger home in a worse location. Match neighborhood quality before size.

### Priority 3: Square Footage
Stay within 20% of your subject's size. A 1,500 square foot subject should use comps between 1,200-1,800 square feet. Larger variances require significant adjustments that reduce confidence.

### Priority 4: Bedroom and Bathroom Count
Functional utility matters. A 3/2 serves different buyers than a 2/1, even at similar square footage.

### Priority 5: Condition
Match renovated homes to renovated homes when calculating ARV. Using dated comps for a post-renovation value creates inaccurate estimates.

### Priority 6: Lot Size
In most suburban markets, lot size matters less than interior living space—unless comparing extreme differences (0.15 acres versus 0.5 acres).

### Priority 7: Garage and Outbuildings
Garages add measurable value, but their absence isn't always a dealbreaker depending on the market.

### Priority 8: Age and Style
A 1950s ranch and a 2010 ranch function similarly but may appeal to different buyers. Match when possible but prioritize other factors first.

## Standard Adjustment Calculations

Adjustments compensate for differences between your subject property (post-renovation) and your comps. Always adjust the comp toward the subject, not vice versa.

### Square Footage Adjustments

**Standard rate: $20-50 per square foot** (varies by market and price point)

Calculate your local rate:
1. Find two similar comps with different square footage
2. Divide the price difference by the square footage difference
3. That's your per-square-foot adjustment rate

Example: Comp A sold for $245,000 at 1,400 SF. Comp B sold for $268,000 at 1,650 SF.
Difference: $23,000 ÷ 250 SF = $92/SF (this market commands premium pricing per foot)

Using this rate: If your subject is 1,500 SF and a comp is 1,350 SF:
1,500 - 1,350 = 150 SF difference
150 SF × $92/SF = $13,800 upward adjustment to the comp

### Bedroom Adjustments
- **Adding a bedroom**: +$3,000 to $7,000
- **Subtracting a bedroom**: -$3,000 to $7,000

Higher-end markets command higher bedroom premiums. A 4th bedroom in a $500,000 neighborhood may add $10,000+, while in a $150,000 neighborhood, it might add only $3,000.

### Bathroom Adjustments
- **Full bathroom**: ±$4,000 to $8,000
- **Half bathroom**: ±$2,500 to $5,000

### Garage Adjustments
- **1-car attached garage**: +$8,000 to $12,000
- **2-car attached garage**: +$12,000 to $20,000
- **Detached garage**: +$5,000 to $10,000
- **Carport**: +$2,000 to $5,000

### Basement Adjustments
- **Finished basement (per SF)**: $15-30/SF
- **Unfinished basement**: $5,000 to $15,000 (depending on size)

### Pool Adjustments
- **In-ground pool**: +$10,000 to $25,000 (market-dependent; some markets value pools negatively due to maintenance)

### Condition Adjustments
- **Fully renovated versus dated**: $15,000 to $50,000+ depending on scope
- **Minor updates versus full renovation**: $10,000 to $25,000

## Using Pending Sales and Active Listings

### Pending/Under Contract Sales

Pending sales reveal where the market is heading right now. While you don't know the final sale price, you know:
- What price attracted a buyer
- How long it took to go under contract
- Current buyer appetite for similar properties

**When to use pending sales:**
- Limited closed comps available
- Market is shifting quickly
- Validating that your ARV attracts buyers
- Supporting your closed comp analysis

Estimate pending sale prices at 97-99% of list price in balanced markets, or at list price in seller's markets with multiple offers.

### Active Listings as Ceiling Indicators

**Critical rule: Active listings represent asking prices, not market value.**

Active listings serve one purpose in comp analysis—they establish the ceiling of what sellers hope to receive. If renovated homes in your target neighborhood are listed at $275,000-$295,000, your ARV should not exceed this range without compelling justification.

**How to use active listings:**
1. Identify actively listed properties similar to your subject post-renovation
2. Note their list prices and days on market
3. If your calculated ARV exceeds active listing prices, investigate why
4. Use listings with 60+ days on market as evidence of overpricing

**Never use active listings to:**
- Set your primary ARV
- Justify inflated values to buyers
- Replace closed sales analysis

## The Bracketing Technique for Confidence

Bracketing means positioning your subject property's estimated ARV between comps that sold higher and lower. This technique provides confidence that your value isn't an outlier.

### How to Bracket Effectively

**Step 1:** Find comps that sold above your estimated ARV
**Step 2:** Find comps that sold below your estimated ARV
**Step 3:** Confirm your subject's characteristics justify its position in the bracket

### Bracketing Example

Subject property (post-renovation): 1,500 SF, 3 bed/2 bath, renovated, 2-car garage
Estimated ARV: $285,000

**Lower bracket comp:** 1,450 SF, 3/2, renovated, 1-car garage, sold $268,000
*Supports your value because your subject has larger size and better garage*

**Upper bracket comp:** 1,550 SF, 3/2, renovated, 2-car garage, sold $295,000
*Supports your value because your subject is slightly smaller*

Your $285,000 ARV sits logically between these two sales based on feature differences.

### When Bracketing Fails

If all your comps fall above or below your estimate, reconsider your ARV. Consistent positioning on one side suggests your estimate needs adjustment.

## Building a Comp Narrative for Buyers and Lenders

Your comp analysis must tell a convincing story. Cash buyers and hard money lenders evaluate deals partly on your ability to justify the ARV professionally.

### Elements of a Strong Comp Narrative

**1. Lead with your best comp**
"The subject property's ARV of $285,000 is primarily supported by 123 Oak Street, which sold 23 days ago at $282,000. This comp is 0.3 miles from the subject, matches in bed/bath count, and sold in renovated condition."

**2. Address each comp individually**
Explain why you selected each comp and what adjustments you made:
"456 Pine Avenue sold at $268,000 but required an upward adjustment of $9,000 for its smaller square footage (1,380 SF versus 1,500 SF) and $8,000 for its single-car garage versus the subject's two-car garage. Adjusted value: $285,000."

**3. Explain omissions**
If you excluded a property that appears comparable, explain why:
"789 Elm Court was excluded despite its proximity because it sold as a distressed sale 12% below market value due to estate liquidation pressures."

**4. Acknowledge limitations**
Transparency builds trust:
"Comp availability was limited due to low winter sales volume. The analysis relies on sales from 90-150 days ago with appropriate market appreciation adjustments applied."

**5. Conclude with confidence level**
"Based on five comparable sales with minimal adjustments required, confidence in the $285,000 ARV is high."

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Using Active Listings as Comps
**Why it's wrong:** Listing prices reflect seller hopes, not market reality. Properties often sell below list price.
**How to avoid:** Only use closed sales for ARV calculation; use active listings only to establish ceilings.

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Location Boundaries
**Why it's wrong:** A highway, railroad, or school district boundary can create significant value differences between adjacent areas.
**How to avoid:** Verify comps are on the same side of natural and administrative boundaries.

### Mistake 3: Over-Adjusting Weak Comps
**Why it's wrong:** Large adjustments compound errors. A comp requiring $40,000 in adjustments provides little confidence.
**How to avoid:** Limit total adjustments to 15-20% of the comp's sale price. If more is needed, find better comps.

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Days on Market
**Why it's wrong:** A comp that sat for 180 days before selling was overpriced. The sale price reflects market resistance.
**How to avoid:** Weight quick-selling comps (under 30 days) more heavily than stale listings.

### Mistake 5: Cherry-Picking High Comps
**Why it's wrong:** Using only the highest comps creates inflated ARVs that won't hold up with buyers or appraisers.
**How to avoid:** Use all relevant comps and let the data speak. Include lower comps and explain why your subject commands more.

### Mistake 6: Comparing Different Property Types
**Why it's wrong:** Buyers for condos, townhouses, and single-family homes have different motivations and price tolerances.
**How to avoid:** Match property type exactly. Only cross-type compare when absolutely no alternatives exist.

### Mistake 7: Neglecting Condition Matching
**Why it's wrong:** Comparing your renovated ARV to dated sales drastically undervalues the property.
**How to avoid:** For ARV calculations, use only renovated/updated comps that match your planned finished condition.

### Mistake 8: Failing to Document Your Analysis
**Why it's wrong:** Buyers and lenders want to see your methodology. Undocumented ARVs appear arbitrary.
**How to avoid:** Create a comp package with photos, addresses, adjustments, and narrative for every deal.

### Mistake 9: Trusting Automated Valuations (AVMs)
**Why it's wrong:** Zillow, Redfin, and other AVMs can't assess condition or renovation quality. They're often 10-20% off.
**How to avoid:** Use AVMs as starting points only. Always verify with manual comp analysis.

### Mistake 10: Skipping Market Trend Analysis
**Why it's wrong:** A 6-month-old comp in a hot market may understate value by 5%+, while the same comp in a declining market overstates it.
**How to avoid:** Always research local appreciation/depreciation trends and apply time adjustments.
