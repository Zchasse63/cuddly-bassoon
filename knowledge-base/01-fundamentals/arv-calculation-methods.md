# After Repair Value (ARV) Calculation Methods: The Complete Guide to Accurate Property Valuation

## Quick Reference

- **ARV Definition**: The estimated market value of a property after all repairs and renovations are completed to bring it to retail condition
- **The Golden Rule**: Your ARV must be conservative—overestimating by 10% can destroy a deal's profit margin entirely
- **Comp Requirements**: Use 3-6 comparable sales within 1 mile, sold within 90 days, within 200 square feet and matching bedroom/bathroom count
- **Primary Adjustment Formula**: Adjusted Comp Value = Sale Price ± (Square Foot Adjustment) ± (Bedroom Adjustment) ± (Bathroom Adjustment) ± (Feature Adjustments)
- **Standard Adjustments**: $40-80/sq ft for size, $5,000-10,000/bedroom, $7,500-15,000/bathroom, $10,000-20,000/garage bay
- **Confidence Threshold**: You need at least 3 strong comps within all parameters to have high confidence; fewer means more risk
- **MLS Access Is Critical**: Public records and Zillow estimates are supplementary—never rely on them as your primary valuation source
- **Market Direction Matters**: Subtract 3-5% from ARV in declining markets; you can be slightly more aggressive in appreciating markets
- **Always Validate**: Drive every comparable and your subject property before finalizing any offer
- **Agent Verification**: Build relationships with investor-friendly agents who can provide CMA reports and market insights

## What Is ARV and Why Accuracy Is Critical

After Repair Value (ARV) represents the price your property will sell for once all renovations are complete and it's listed on the open market in retail condition. This single number is the foundation upon which every wholesaling calculation rests.

When you calculate your Maximum Allowable Offer (MAO), you work backward from ARV:

**MAO = ARV × 70% - Repair Costs - Your Wholesale Fee**

Consider this scenario: You estimate an ARV of $250,000 on a property needing $40,000 in repairs. Using the 70% rule with a $10,000 wholesale fee, your MAO is $125,000. Your seller accepts, and you assign the contract for $135,000.

But what if your ARV was wrong? What if the actual ARV is $220,000?

Your buyer's MAO becomes: $220,000 × 70% - $40,000 = $114,000. They won't pay $135,000 for a property worth $114,000 to them. Your deal falls apart, you waste weeks of effort, and your reputation takes a hit.

**A 12% ARV miscalculation turned a profitable deal into a dead one.**

This is why experienced wholesalers treat ARV calculation as the most critical skill in their toolkit. Every dollar you're wrong on ARV amplifies through your entire deal structure.

## The Comp Selection Process: Proximity, Recency, and Similarity

Finding appropriate comparable sales (comps) requires applying three filters in order of importance: proximity, recency, and similarity. Think of these as gates that each potential comp must pass through.

### Proximity: The Geographic Filter

**Tier 1 (Ideal):** Same subdivision or immediate neighborhood—within 0.5 miles
**Tier 2 (Acceptable):** Same general area with similar characteristics—within 1 mile
**Tier 3 (Use with Caution):** Extended area if Tier 1 and 2 are insufficient—within 2 miles

Geographic proximity matters because neighborhoods have micro-markets. A house one mile east might be in a completely different school district, flood zone, or desirability category.

**Critical Boundaries to Watch:**
- School district lines
- Major roads or highways
- Railroad tracks
- Bodies of water
- Commercial zones
- HOA boundaries

A house selling for $300,000 on one side of a major highway might have comps at $240,000 on the other side. Never cross significant boundaries without adjusting accordingly.

### Recency: The Time Filter

**Tier 1 (Ideal):** Sold within 30 days
**Tier 2 (Acceptable):** Sold within 90 days
**Tier 3 (Use with Caution):** Sold within 180 days (apply market appreciation/depreciation adjustments)

Markets move. A comp from eight months ago might reflect an entirely different pricing environment. In hot markets, prices can shift 5-10% in just 90 days.

**Recency Adjustment Formula:**
If using older comps, apply monthly appreciation or depreciation rates:
- Appreciating market at 0.5%/month: A $200,000 comp from 4 months ago adjusts to $204,000
- Declining market at 0.5%/month: A $200,000 comp from 4 months ago adjusts to $196,000

### Similarity: The Property Filter

After passing geographic and time filters, comps must match your subject property's characteristics:

**Must Match (Non-Negotiable):**
- Property type (single-family, townhome, condo)
- Bedroom count (within ±1)
- Bathroom count (within ±1)
- Square footage (within ±20% or 200 sq ft)
- Stories (single-story vs. two-story)

**Should Match (Strong Preference):**
- Construction style (ranch, colonial, split-level)
- Year built (within ±10 years)
- Lot size (within ±25%)
- Garage (attached vs. detached, car count)
- Basement (finished, unfinished, none)

**Nice to Match:**
- Pool
- View/waterfront
- Corner lot
- Updates and finishes

## Standard Adjustment Values

When comps don't perfectly match your subject property, you apply adjustments. These adjustments add or subtract value based on the differences between the comp and your subject.

**The Adjustment Principle:** Always adjust the comp TO match the subject, not the other way around.

If your subject has 3 bedrooms and the comp has 4 bedrooms, you subtract from the comp's value (because your subject is worth less than a 4-bedroom home).

### Square Footage Adjustments

Square footage adjustments vary significantly by price point and market:

| Market Price Point | Adjustment per Square Foot |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Under $150,000 | $40-60/sq ft |
| $150,000-$300,000 | $60-80/sq ft |
| $300,000-$500,000 | $80-120/sq ft |
| Over $500,000 | $100-150/sq ft |

**Calculation Example:**
- Subject property: 1,400 sq ft
- Comp: 1,600 sq ft, sold for $240,000
- Difference: 200 sq ft
- Adjustment rate: $70/sq ft
- Adjustment: 200 × $70 = $14,000 (subtract because subject is smaller)
- Adjusted comp value: $240,000 - $14,000 = $226,000

### Bedroom and Bathroom Adjustments

| Feature | Low-End Markets | Mid-Range Markets | High-End Markets |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Bedroom | $5,000-7,000 | $7,500-10,000 | $10,000-15,000 |
| Full Bath | $7,500-10,000 | $10,000-15,000 | $15,000-25,000 |
| Half Bath | $3,500-5,000 | $5,000-7,500 | $7,500-12,000 |

**Important Note:** Bedroom and bathroom adjustments are not perfectly linear. Going from 2 bedrooms to 3 bedrooms typically adds more value than going from 4 bedrooms to 5 bedrooms. Most buyers want 3 bedrooms minimum; beyond 4, additional bedrooms have diminishing returns.

### Garage and Parking Adjustments

| Garage Type | Adjustment Value |
|-------------|-----------------|
| 1-car attached garage | $10,000-15,000 |
| 2-car attached garage | $18,000-25,000 |
| 3-car attached garage | $25,000-35,000 |
| Detached garage | 70-80% of attached values |
| Carport | $3,000-5,000 |

### Lot Size Adjustments

Lot adjustments are highly market-dependent. In urban areas, lot size matters less. In suburban and rural areas, it matters significantly.

**General Guidelines:**
- Urban/suburban: $1-3 per additional square foot of lot
- Rural: $0.25-1 per additional square foot
- Maximum adjustment: Usually cap at $15,000-25,000 for lot size differences

### Age Adjustments

Newer homes command premiums for updated building codes, energy efficiency, and lower maintenance expectations.

**Standard Age Adjustment:**
- Apply 0.5-1% of value per year of age difference
- Usually cap adjustments at 20 years difference

**Example:**
- Subject: Built 2010
- Comp: Built 2000, sold for $280,000
- Age difference: 10 years
- Adjustment rate: 0.75% per year
- Adjustment: $280,000 × 0.75% × 10 = $21,000 (add because subject is newer)
- Adjusted value: $301,000

### Condition and Feature Adjustments

| Feature | Typical Adjustment |
|---------|-------------------|
| Pool (in-ground) | $15,000-30,000 |
| Finished basement | $15-25/sq ft |
| Updated kitchen | $10,000-25,000 |
| Updated bathrooms | $5,000-12,000 each |
| Hardwood floors | $5,000-10,000 |
| Fireplace | $3,000-7,000 |
| Central AC (where not standard) | $5,000-10,000 |
| New roof | $5,000-10,000 |
| Deck/patio | $3,000-8,000 |

## Red Flags That Indicate Unreliable Comps

Not all sales make good comps. Watch for these warning signs:

### Transaction Red Flags

1. **REO/Bank-Owned Sales:** Often sold 10-20% below market value due to as-is condition and motivated selling
2. **Short Sales:** May reflect distressed pricing, not true market value
3. **Estate Sales:** Frequently priced to sell quickly, not maximize value
4. **Family Transfers:** Sales between relatives often don't reflect market pricing
5. **Days on Market Over 90:** Extended DOM suggests initial overpricing; final sale price may be below market
6. **Days on Market Under 7:** Extremely fast sales often indicate underpricing

### Property Red Flags

1. **Significant Repairs Needed:** A comp that sold as-is with major issues isn't comparable to your renovated property
2. **Unusual Features:** Properties with unique characteristics (converted churches, homes on major roads) don't comp well
3. **Seller Concessions:** A sale at $200,000 with $15,000 in seller concessions really sold at $185,000
4. **Lease-Option or Seller Financing:** Creative financing often inflates apparent sale prices

### Market Red Flags

1. **Only 1-2 Comps Available:** Insufficient data means high uncertainty
2. **Wide Price Range:** If comps range from $180,000 to $260,000, you don't have reliable data
3. **All Comps Are Adjusted Heavily:** If every comp requires $30,000+ in adjustments, none are truly comparable

## Using Different Data Sources: MLS vs Public Records vs Zillow vs RentCast

### MLS (Multiple Listing Service)

**Pros:**
- Most accurate and detailed data
- Includes interior photos, showing actual condition
- Shows days on market and price history
- Reveals seller concessions
- Updated in real-time

**Cons:**
- Requires licensed agent access
- Some markets have fragmented MLS coverage

**Best Use:** Primary data source for all ARV calculations

### Public Records

**Pros:**
- Free access through county assessor websites
- Shows all recorded sales, not just MLS listings
- Includes tax assessments and property details
- Covers FSBO and off-market transactions

**Cons:**
- Often 30-90 days behind actual closings
- No interior condition information
- Limited property details
- No photos

**Best Use:** Supplementary source to catch non-MLS sales; verification of MLS data

### Zillow and Automated Valuation Models (AVMs)

**Pros:**
- Free and easy access
- Provides estimated value range
- Shows sold and active listings
- Useful for quick initial screening

**Cons:**
- Zestimate accuracy varies wildly (can be off by 20%+)
- Cannot distinguish between renovated and distressed properties
- Doesn't account for interior condition
- Updates lag behind market changes

**Best Use:** Initial screening only; never use Zillow estimates as your ARV

### RentCast and Data Aggregators

**Pros:**
- Aggregates multiple data sources
- Provides rental data for investment analysis
- Often includes market trends
- API access for scaling

**Cons:**
- Data quality varies by market
- May not have recent sales in thin markets
- Subscription costs

**Best Use:** Supplementary data and rental analysis; useful for investor-heavy markets

**The Bottom Line:** Always use MLS as your primary source. Use other sources to supplement and verify, but never substitute them for proper MLS research.

## How to Calculate ARV in Different Market Conditions

### Appreciating Markets

In rising markets, your ARV has some buffer because values continue climbing between your analysis and your buyer's exit.

**Adjustments for Appreciating Markets:**
1. Weight recent comps (30-60 days) more heavily than older comps
2. You can use pending sales as supporting evidence for higher values
3. Active listings priced above recent sales may indicate where the market is heading
4. Consider adding 2-3% for anticipated appreciation during the flip period (3-6 months)

**Warning:** Don't get greedy. Many wholesalers have lost deals by expecting appreciation that never materialized. Stay conservative.

### Declining Markets

Falling markets require extra caution because your buyer will exit at lower prices than current comps suggest.

**Adjustments for Declining Markets:**
1. Use only the most recent comps (30-45 days maximum)
2. Reduce your ARV by 3-5% below current comps
3. Pay close attention to days on market—increasing DOM signals pricing pressure
4. Weight lower comps more heavily than higher comps
5. Consider expired listings as evidence of price ceiling

**Example Adjustment:**
- Current comps suggest ARV of $200,000
- Market declining at 0.5%/month
- Expected flip timeline: 6 months
- Adjusted ARV: $200,000 - (0.5% × 6) = $200,000 × 0.97 = $194,000

### Stable Markets

In stable markets, current comps provide the most reliable ARV indicators. Focus on:
- Using comps from the last 90 days
- Weighting the median comp value (not the highest)
- Ensuring adequate comp quantity (minimum 3-4 strong comps)

## Confidence Levels: When You Have High vs Low Confidence in ARV

Understanding your confidence level helps you adjust your offer strategy accordingly.

### High Confidence Indicators

You can trust your ARV when:
- 4+ comps within 0.5 miles, sold in last 60 days
- All comps require less than $15,000 in adjustments
- Comps are within 5% of each other
- Subject property is in a standard subdivision with consistent housing stock
- You've personally viewed comps and confirmed condition
- Agent verification confirms your analysis

**Strategy with High Confidence:** You can work closer to your MAO formula and accept tighter margins.

### Moderate Confidence Indicators

Proceed with caution when:
- 3 comps available, requiring moderate adjustments
- Comps sold 60-120 days ago
- Subject property has one or two unusual features
- Price spread of 10-15% among comps

**Strategy with Moderate Confidence:** Reduce your ARV by 5% as a safety buffer.

### Low Confidence Indicators

Be very careful when:
- Only 1-2 comps available
- All comps require significant adjustments ($25,000+)
- Comps are 120+ days old
- Subject property is unique in design or location
- Price spread exceeds 20% among comps
- Market is in transition (major employer closing, new development pending)

**Strategy with Low Confidence:** Either reduce ARV by 10-15% or walk away from the deal. High uncertainty equals high risk.

## The Drive-By Validation Method

Never trust comps on paper alone. The drive-by validation method confirms your analysis reflects reality.

### Driving the Comps

For every comp in your analysis:

1. **Drive the Neighborhood:** Note the overall condition—are homes maintained? Are there abandoned properties or cars on blocks?

2. **Observe the Comp Property:** Does exterior condition match what MLS photos showed? Has anything changed since sale?

3. **Compare to Subject:** Is this really the same neighborhood quality? Would the same buyers consider both properties?

4. **Note Differences:** Busy road? Backing to commercial? Power lines? These details don't always appear in listing data.

### Driving Your Subject Property

Even before putting in an offer:

1. **Time Your Drive:** Visit at different times—morning, evening, weekends—to understand neighborhood activity

2. **Talk to Neighbors:** "I'm looking at buying the property down the street. What's it like living here?" You'll learn more in 5 minutes than hours of research.

3. **Look for Hidden Issues:** Foundation cracks, roof sag, drainage problems, additions that look unpermitted

4. **Assess Curb Appeal Potential:** What will this property look like after renovation? Can you achieve comp-level presentation?

### Documentation

Take photos and notes during every drive-by. This documentation serves multiple purposes:
- Supports your ARV when presenting to buyers
- Helps you remember details across multiple deals
- Provides evidence if disputes arise

## Working with Agents to Verify ARV Estimates

Real estate agents are invaluable partners for ARV verification. An experienced investor-friendly agent sees dozens of transactions monthly and understands nuances that data can't capture.

### Finding the Right Agent

Look for agents who:
- Work with investors regularly
- Understand wholesale transactions
- Have local market expertise (at least 3 years in your target area)
- Respond quickly and provide thorough analysis
- Won't try to convert every conversation into a listing appointment

### How to Request Help

**Script for Agent Outreach:**
"Hi [Agent Name], I'm a real estate investor working in [area]. I'm analyzing a property at [address] and would value your professional opinion on the ARV after full renovation. Would you be willing to run a quick CMA for me? I'd be happy to send any deals your way that aren't right for wholesale, and I'm always looking for good agents to recommend to my buyers."

### What to Ask Agents

1. "What would you list this property for after a full renovation?"
2. "What are buyers paying for similar homes right now?"
3. "How long are renovated homes sitting on market in this area?"
4. "Are there any market factors I should know about—new construction, school changes, employers coming or going?"
5. "Would you feel confident this property would sell at $X in the next 6 months?"

### Building Long-Term Relationships

The best agent relationships develop when you provide value in return:
- Refer leads that don't fit your wholesale criteria
- Send buyer clients their way
- Share market intelligence you gather
- Be respectful of their time—don't ask for CMAs on properties you're not seriously considering

## Examples

### Example 1: Standard ARV Calculation

**Subject Property:**
- Address: 123 Oak Street
- 3 bed, 2 bath, 1,400 sq ft
- Built 1995
- 1-car garage
- 0.25-acre lot
- Needs full renovation to retail condition

**Comp 1:** 456 Oak Street
- 3 bed, 2 bath, 1,550 sq ft, 2-car garage
- Sold 25 days ago for $235,000

**Adjustments:**
- Square footage: -150 sq ft × $70 = -$10,500
- Garage: -1 bay × $12,000 = -$12,000
- **Adjusted Value: $212,500**

**Comp 2:** 789 Elm Street (same subdivision)
- 3 bed, 2 bath, 1,380 sq ft, 1-car garage
- Sold 45 days ago for $218,000

**Adjustments:**
- Square footage: +20 sq ft × $70 = +$1,400
- **Adjusted Value: $219,400**

**Comp 3:** 321 Maple Drive
- 4 bed, 2 bath, 1,500 sq ft, 1-car garage
- Sold 60 days ago for $228,000

**Adjustments:**
- Bedroom: -1 × $8,000 = -$8,000
- Square footage: -100 sq ft × $70 = -$7,000
- **Adjusted Value: $213,000**

**ARV Calculation:**
- Adjusted Comp Average: ($212,500 + $219,400 + $213,000) ÷ 3 = $214,967
- **Conservative ARV: $215,000**

### Example 2: Low-Confidence Scenario

**Subject Property:**
- Unique A-frame home on 2 acres
- 2 bed, 1 bath, 1,100 sq ft
- Rural location with only 2 sales in last 6 months

**Comp 1:** Only similar A-frame in area
- Sold 8 months ago for $145,000
- Required updating; subject will be fully renovated

**Comp 2:** Traditional ranch on 1 acre
- 3 bed, 2 bath, 1,300 sq ft
- Sold 4 months ago for $175,000
- Not comparable in style

**Analysis:**
This is a low-confidence scenario. You have insufficient comparable data and a unique property type. Options:
1. Use $145,000 as base, add $15,000 for renovation = $160,000 tentative ARV, then discount 15% = **$136,000 conservative ARV**
2. Pass on the deal due to excessive uncertainty

### Example 3: Declining Market Adjustment

**Subject Property:**
- Standard 3/2 ranch, 1,500 sq ft
- Good subdivision, ample comps

**Comp Analysis:**
- 3 comps from last 60 days average $245,000 adjusted
- However, market showing 0.75% monthly decline
- Average days on market increased from 30 to 55 days
- 2 recent price reductions in subdivision

**ARV Calculation:**
- Base ARV from comps: $245,000
- Decline adjustment (6-month flip period): $245,000 × (0.75% × 6) = -$11,025
- **Adjusted ARV: $234,000**

## Common Mistakes

1. **Using the Highest Comp:** Beginners often cherry-pick the highest-priced comp to justify their ARV. Always weight toward the median or average of adjusted comps.

2. **Ignoring Seller Concessions:** A comp showing $200,000 with $10,000 in seller concessions effectively sold for $190,000. Always adjust for concessions.

3. **Crossing Market Boundaries:** Using a comp from across a major road or school district boundary without significant adjustments distorts your ARV.

4. **Over-Adjusting Single Comps:** If you're adjusting a single comp by $40,000+, it's not actually comparable. Find better comps.

5. **Trusting Zillow Estimates:** Zestimates are algorithms, not appraisals. They can be off by 20% or more, especially for distressed properties.

6. **Skipping the Drive-By:** Paper analysis misses critical factors: busy roads, deferred maintenance, neighborhood quality. Always validate in person.

7. **Assuming Full Retail Finish:** Your ARV must match what your subject will look like after renovation. If you're estimating a budget renovation, don't use comps with high-end finishes.

8. **Ignoring Days on Market:** A house that sat for 180 days before selling at $200,000 tells a different story than one that sold in 7 days at the same price.

9. **Not Accounting for Market Direction:** Using 6-month-old comps in a rapidly changing market leads to stale valuations. Adjust for appreciation or depreciation.

10. **Skipping Agent Verification:** Agents see what the data doesn't show. A 5-minute conversation can save you from a $20,000 mistake.
