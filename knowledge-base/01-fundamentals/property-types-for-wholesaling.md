# Property Types for Wholesaling - Complete Guide to SFR, Multi-Family, Commercial, Land, and More

## Quick Reference

- **Single-family residential (SFR)** offers the largest buyer pool and simplest valuation—start here if you're new to wholesaling
- **Multi-family (2-4 units)** commands higher assignment fees ($8,000-$25,000+) but requires understanding rental income analysis
- **Commercial properties (5+ units)** attract sophisticated buyers and offer larger fees but demand longer timelines and specialized knowledge
- **Land deals** can yield massive profits (10-30% of land value) with minimal competition but require understanding of development potential
- **Mobile homes** are often overlooked goldmines with assignment fees of $2,000-$8,000 and almost zero competition
- **Condos and townhomes** require HOA due diligence—always verify assignment rights and rental restrictions before contracting
- **Buyer pool size decreases** as property complexity increases: SFR > Multi-family > Commercial > Land
- **Valuation methods differ dramatically**: SFR uses comparable sales, multi-family uses income approach, commercial uses cap rates
- **Your first 10 deals** should focus exclusively on single-family homes to build foundational skills

## Understanding Property Types in Wholesaling

Not all properties are created equal when it comes to wholesaling. Each property type presents unique opportunities, challenges, buyer demographics, and profit potential. Understanding these differences separates successful wholesalers who build sustainable businesses from those who chase random deals and burn out.

The property type you choose affects everything: how you find deals, how you analyze them, who your buyers are, how long deals take to close, and how much you can earn per transaction. This guide gives you the complete picture so you can make strategic decisions about where to focus your marketing dollars and time.

## Single-Family Residential (SFR) - The Bread and Butter

Single-family homes represent approximately 70-80% of all wholesale transactions nationwide. There's a reason every experienced wholesaler tells beginners to start here.

### Why SFR Dominates Wholesaling

**Largest buyer pool available.** For every SFR deal you put under contract, you potentially have hundreds of interested buyers. This includes:
- Fix-and-flip investors (most common)
- Buy-and-hold rental investors
- Owner-occupants looking for fixer-uppers
- Turnkey rental companies
- Hedge funds and institutional buyers

**Simplest valuation method.** You analyze SFR properties using comparable sales (comps). Find three to five similar homes that sold recently within a half-mile radius, adjust for differences, and you have your ARV. No complex income calculations required.

**Fastest closings.** SFR wholesale deals typically close in 14-30 days. Buyers know exactly how to evaluate these properties and can make quick decisions.

**Easiest financing for buyers.** Your cash buyers can use hard money loans, private money, or conventional financing for investment properties. More financing options mean more potential buyers.

### SFR Profit Potential

Typical assignment fees range from $5,000 to $15,000, with an average around $8,000-$10,000 in most markets. Higher-priced markets (California, New York, Florida coastal) can yield $15,000-$30,000 per deal.

### Ideal SFR Targets for Wholesaling

Focus your marketing on these property characteristics:
- **Price range:** $100,000-$400,000 (sweet spot for most investor buyers)
- **Bedrooms:** 3+ bedrooms
- **Condition:** Needs $20,000-$80,000 in repairs (enough room for investor profit)
- **Age:** 20+ years old
- **Motivation indicators:** Pre-foreclosure, probate, divorce, code violations, tax delinquency

### SFR Valuation Formula

**ARV - Repairs - Investor Profit - Closing Costs - Your Fee = Maximum Offer**

Using the 70% Rule:
**Maximum Offer = (ARV × 0.70) - Repair Costs**

Example: A 3-bedroom home has an ARV of $250,000 and needs $40,000 in repairs.
- Maximum Offer = ($250,000 × 0.70) - $40,000
- Maximum Offer = $175,000 - $40,000
- Maximum Offer = $135,000

Your assignment fee comes from the spread between your contract price and what your buyer pays.

## Multi-Family Properties (2-4 Units) - Duplexes, Triplexes, and Quads

Multi-family properties with 2-4 units occupy a unique space—they're still considered residential for financing purposes but attract a different buyer profile and command higher assignment fees.

### Why Wholesalers Love Small Multi-Family

**Higher assignment fees.** Expect $8,000-$25,000 per deal, with some markets yielding $30,000+. The higher purchase prices and rental income potential justify larger spreads.

**Serious buyers.** Multi-family investors are typically more experienced and decisive. They understand numbers-based analysis and can evaluate deals quickly.

**Less competition from retail buyers.** Owner-occupants rarely compete for multi-family properties, giving you cleaner transactions with investors only.

**Recurring need.** Rental investors building portfolios need multiple properties. One good buyer relationship can result in 5-10 deals per year.

### Multi-Family Buyer Pool

Your buyer pool shrinks compared to SFR but remains substantial:
- Rental portfolio investors (primary buyers)
- House hackers (owner-occupants who live in one unit)
- Syndication groups
- Property management companies
- 1031 exchange buyers

Estimate roughly 40-60% of the buyer pool size compared to SFR in most markets.

### Valuation Differences - The Income Approach

Multi-family properties are valued primarily on rental income, not just comparable sales. You need to understand these metrics:

**Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM):**
GRM = Property Price ÷ Annual Gross Rent

**Cap Rate:**
Cap Rate = Net Operating Income (NOI) ÷ Property Price

**Example Analysis:**
A duplex generates $2,400/month in combined rent ($28,800/year).
- Operating expenses: $8,640/year (30% of gross rent)
- NOI: $28,800 - $8,640 = $20,160
- If investors want an 8% cap rate: $20,160 ÷ 0.08 = $252,000 maximum value
- Your offer price must leave room for repairs, profit, and your fee

### Multi-Family Due Diligence Requirements

Before assigning a multi-family contract, verify:
- Current rent roll and lease terms
- Actual utility costs (who pays what)
- Recent rent collection history
- Unit conditions and deferred maintenance
- Local rent control regulations
- Certificate of occupancy status

## Small Commercial Properties (5+ Units, Retail, Office)

Stepping into commercial wholesaling opens doors to significantly larger deals—and significantly larger assignment fees. However, the complexity increases proportionally.

### Types of Small Commercial Properties

**5+ Unit Apartment Buildings:** These are valued purely on income and trade in the commercial market.

**Retail Properties:** Strip malls, standalone retail buildings, mixed-use with ground-floor retail.

**Office Buildings:** Small professional office spaces, medical office buildings.

**Industrial/Flex Space:** Warehouses, light manufacturing, distribution centers.

### Commercial Wholesaling Realities

**Assignment fees:** $15,000-$100,000+ per deal. The higher complexity justifies higher compensation.

**Smaller buyer pool:** You're dealing with commercial investors, developers, and institutions. Expect 10-20% of the buyer pool size compared to SFR.

**Longer timelines:** Commercial deals take 45-90 days to close. Due diligence is extensive.

**Higher barriers to entry:** Buyers expect you to understand commercial real estate fundamentals, including:
- Net Operating Income (NOI) analysis
- Cap rate comparisons by property class
- Lease abstracts and tenant credit analysis
- Environmental concerns (Phase I requirements)
- Zoning and permitted use verification

### When to Consider Commercial Wholesaling

Wait until you've completed at least 20-30 residential wholesale deals before pursuing commercial properties. The learning curve is steep, and mistakes are expensive. Commercial sellers are more sophisticated and expect you to know what you're doing.

### Commercial Valuation

**Value = NOI ÷ Cap Rate**

Example: An 8-unit apartment building generates $72,000 NOI annually. Market cap rate is 7%.
- Value = $72,000 ÷ 0.07 = $1,028,571
- Your analysis must account for deferred maintenance, vacancy assumptions, and rent comparisons

## Land Deals - The Overlooked Opportunity

Land wholesaling represents one of the most underutilized strategies in the industry. Competition is minimal because most wholesalers don't understand how to value land.

### Why Land Deals Work

**Almost zero competition.** Most wholesalers avoid land because they can't apply the 70% rule or pull comps easily.

**Motivated sellers.** Land owners often inherited property, live out of state, or simply tire of paying taxes on non-income-producing assets.

**Lower acquisition costs.** You can often lock up land deals with $100-$500 earnest money deposits.

**Massive profit margins.** Assignment fees of 10-30% of land value are common because of the difficulty in valuation.

### Land Buyer Profile

Your land buyers include:
- Developers (residential and commercial)
- Builders
- Neighboring property owners
- Investors banking land for appreciation
- Government entities for public projects

Buyer pool is smallest of all categories—perhaps 5-10% compared to SFR. However, dedicated land investors build relationships with wholesalers and buy repeatedly.

### Land Valuation Methods

**Comparable sales approach:** Find similar land parcels that sold recently. This works for residential lots and rural acreage.

**Development potential analysis:** Calculate what can be built on the land, the finished value, development costs, and work backward to land value. Developers typically pay 15-25% of the finished project value for raw land.

**Income potential:** For agricultural or mineral rights land, value based on annual income production.

### Land Due Diligence Essentials

- Zoning verification and permitted uses
- Utility availability (water, sewer, electric, gas)
- Road access and easements
- Flood zone status
- Environmental contamination concerns
- Survey requirements
- HOA or deed restrictions

## Mobile Homes and Manufactured Housing

Mobile homes represent perhaps the most overlooked wholesale opportunity. The stigma surrounding manufactured housing means almost no competition, yet millions of Americans live in and invest in this asset class.

### The Mobile Home Opportunity

**Minimal competition.** Most wholesalers won't touch mobile homes. This creates opportunity.

**Affordable price points.** Typical deals involve properties valued at $30,000-$150,000, making buyer financing easier.

**Assignment fees:** $2,000-$8,000 per deal with some markets yielding $10,000+.

**High volume potential.** Lower prices mean you can close more deals per month.

### Critical Mobile Home Considerations

**Land-owned vs. lot rent:** Mobile homes on owned land wholesale like traditional real estate. Mobile homes in parks (paying lot rent) are personal property, not real estate—these require different contracts and buyer pools.

**Title vs. deed:** Mobile homes may have vehicle-like titles rather than deeds. Verify ownership documentation before contracting.

**Age restrictions:** Many investors avoid mobile homes manufactured before 1976 (pre-HUD standards). Some won't touch anything older than 1990.

**Park approval:** For park-based mobile homes, buyers need park management approval. Verify transfer policies before marketing.

### Mobile Home Buyer Pool

- Mobile home park investors (buying homes to rent)
- Affordable housing investors
- Owner-occupants (large pool due to affordability)
- Seller-financing investors

## Condos and Townhomes - HOA Considerations

Condos and townhomes can be profitable wholesale targets, but HOA regulations create landmines that catch unprepared wholesalers.

### Why Condos Can Work

**Lower price points:** In expensive markets, condos provide entry-level investment opportunities.

**Strong rental demand:** Young professionals and students often prefer condo living.

**First-time buyer appeal:** Your exit strategy can include owner-occupant buyers.

### The HOA Problem

Before putting any condo under contract, investigate these HOA issues:

**Assignment restrictions:** Some HOAs prohibit or restrict contract assignments. They may require buyer approval before any transfer. Always read the CC&Rs before signing a purchase agreement.

**Right of first refusal:** Many HOAs can match any purchase offer, effectively blocking your wholesale deal.

**Rental restrictions:** If the HOA limits rentals (percentage caps or outright prohibitions), you've eliminated investor buyers from your pool.

**Financial health:** HOAs with deferred maintenance, pending special assessments, or litigation scare away buyers. Request financial statements.

**FHA/VA approval status:** If the condo project isn't approved for government-backed loans, you've significantly reduced your buyer pool.

### Townhome Advantages

Townhomes typically have fewer restrictions than condos. Many have minimal HOAs covering only common areas. They also offer:
- Fee-simple ownership (you own the land)
- More privacy and space
- Easier resale to owner-occupants

## Buyer Pool Comparison by Property Type

Understanding buyer pool size helps you prioritize your marketing efforts:

| Property Type | Relative Buyer Pool Size | Typical Assignment Fee | Closing Timeline |
|---------------|-------------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| SFR | 100% (baseline) | $5,000-$15,000 | 14-30 days |
| Multi-family (2-4) | 40-60% | $8,000-$25,000 | 21-45 days |
| Condos/Townhomes | 50-70% | $4,000-$12,000 | 14-30 days |
| Mobile Homes | 20-30% | $2,000-$8,000 | 14-21 days |
| Land | 5-10% | 10-30% of value | 30-60 days |
| Commercial (5+) | 10-20% | $15,000-$100,000+ | 45-90 days |

## Valuation Methods Summary

| Property Type | Primary Valuation Method | Key Metrics |
|---------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| SFR | Comparable Sales | Price per square foot, ARV |
| Multi-family (2-4) | Income + Comps | GRM, Cap Rate, Price per unit |
| Commercial | Income Approach | NOI, Cap Rate, Price per unit/SF |
| Land | Development Potential + Comps | Price per acre/SF, zoning |
| Mobile Homes | Comparable Sales + Age | Year built, condition, land ownership |
| Condos | Comparable Sales | Price per SF, HOA fees, amenities |

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Starting with Complex Property Types
New wholesalers often chase multi-family or commercial deals hoping for bigger fees. This leads to analysis paralysis, deals falling through, and burnout. Master SFR first.

### Mistake 2: Ignoring HOA Restrictions on Condos
Contracting a condo without verifying assignment rights can result in a deal you legally cannot wholesale. Always review CC&Rs before signing.

### Mistake 3: Using SFR Valuation Methods on Multi-Family
Applying the 70% rule to a rental property ignores income potential. A property in perfect condition can still be a great wholesale deal if it's underpriced relative to rental income.

### Mistake 4: Overlooking Mobile Home Title Issues
Mobile homes may have lien issues, missing titles, or complicated ownership structures. Verify clean title before marketing to buyers.

### Mistake 5: Not Building Specialized Buyer Lists
Your SFR buyer list differs from your commercial buyer list. Segment your buyers by property type preference to market appropriate deals.

### Mistake 6: Underestimating Land Due Diligence
Zoning, environmental issues, utility access, and easements can kill land deals. Always verify development potential before committing.

### Mistake 7: Assuming All Multi-Family Investors Want All Multi-Family
Duplex investors often don't want 8-unit buildings and vice versa. Qualify your buyers by unit count preference.

### Mistake 8: Neglecting Commercial Deal Timelines
Commercial buyers need longer inspection periods and due diligence timelines. Writing 14-day inspection periods into commercial contracts will cost you buyers.

### Mistake 9: Ignoring Property Type Market Conditions
Some markets have excess multi-family inventory while SFR is tight. Understand your local market dynamics before specializing.

### Mistake 10: Failing to Adjust Marketing by Property Type
Direct mail copy that works for SFR doesn't work for commercial property owners. Tailor your message to each property type.

## Which Property Types to Start With

**Your first 10 deals:** Focus exclusively on single-family residential homes. Build your negotiation skills, understand the contract process, and develop reliable buyers.

**Deals 11-30:** Consider adding multi-family (2-4 units) to your strategy. The valuation skills you develop here prepare you for commercial.

**After 30+ deals:** Evaluate whether land, commercial, or mobile homes make sense for your market. Many successful wholesalers specialize in one property type and dominate that niche.

**The strategic path:**
1. Master SFR → Highest deal flow, simplest transactions
2. Add multi-family → Higher fees, builds income analysis skills
3. Specialize or expand → Commercial, land, or mobile homes based on market opportunity
