# Capability Matrix

## Purpose

This document describes platform capabilities in terms of **what's possible**, not just documented use cases. Each capability can be applied in many ways beyond the examples given.

## Core Capability Categories

### 1. Property Intelligence

**What the platform CAN DO:**
- Look up any property by address, parcel, or coordinates
- Retrieve comprehensive property characteristics
- Access owner information and history
- Get tax and assessment data
- View sales history and transaction details
- Identify property type, features, and attributes

**Beyond standard use:**
- Cross-reference multiple properties to find patterns
- Compare properties to derive market insights
- Use property data to validate other information
- Build property profiles from multiple data sources

### 2. Valuation & Analysis

**What the platform CAN DO:**
- Estimate current market value (AVM)
- Calculate After Repair Value (ARV)
- Find and analyze comparable sales
- Calculate Maximum Allowable Offer (MAO)
- Assess repair costs
- Analyze deal economics and profitability

**Beyond standard use:**
- Reverse-calculate required ARV from a target price
- Compare valuation across time to spot trends
- Use comp data to understand neighborhood pricing
- Layer multiple valuation sources for confidence
- Create custom deal scoring models

### 3. Seller Motivation Assessment

**What the platform CAN DO:**
- Score seller motivation from multiple signals
- Identify absentee and out-of-state owners
- Detect equity levels and financial position
- Recognize distress signals (tax, liens, foreclosure)
- Assess ownership duration and tenure patterns
- Identify life event indicators

**Beyond standard use:**
- Combine signals in custom weightings
- Track motivation changes over time
- Predict future motivation from leading indicators
- Create custom motivation models for specific strategies
- Use motivation to prioritize and time outreach

### 4. Market Intelligence

**What the platform CAN DO:**
- Analyze market statistics (price, DOM, inventory)
- Track price and velocity trends
- Compare markets and submarkets
- Access demographic data
- Monitor market health indicators
- Assess competition and investor activity

**Beyond standard use:**
- Create composite market scores
- Identify market timing opportunities
- Find emerging/underserved markets
- Use market data to inform negotiation
- Predict market direction from indicator trends

### 5. Geographic Analysis

**What the platform CAN DO:**
- Search and filter by location
- Map properties and visualize data
- Create heat maps of activity/concentration
- Calculate drive times and distances
- Define custom geographic boundaries
- Cluster properties by area

**Beyond standard use:**
- Optimize driving routes through lead clusters
- Identify geographic patterns in motivation
- Find neighborhood transition zones
- Use proximity data for targeting
- Layer multiple geographic data sets

### 6. Permit & Construction Intelligence

**What the platform CAN DO:**
- Access permit history for properties
- Track permit status and timeline
- Identify contractor information
- Assess renovation activity by area
- Evaluate contractor quality metrics
- Estimate repair costs from permit data

**Beyond standard use:**
- Use permits to assess owner investment behavior
- Identify stalled projects as motivation signals
- Validate repair estimates with actual permit costs
- Find active renovation neighborhoods
- Assess property condition from permit history

### 7. Buyer & Exit Management

**What the platform CAN DO:**
- Track buyer preferences and criteria
- Match properties to buyer requirements
- Manage buyer relationships and activity
- Score property-buyer fit
- Track buyer history and patterns
- Communicate with buyer network

**Beyond standard use:**
- Reverse-engineer acquisition criteria from buyer needs
- Predict buyer interest from behavior patterns
- Find new buyers through transaction analysis
- Use buyer data to prioritize acquisitions
- Create buyer-driven search strategies

### 8. Pipeline & CRM

**What the platform CAN DO:**
- Track leads through stages
- Manage follow-up sequences
- Record contact history
- Score and prioritize leads
- Manage deals and transactions
- Track activities and tasks

**Beyond standard use:**
- Analyze pipeline patterns for optimization
- Use historical data to predict conversion
- Automate prioritization logic
- Create custom scoring models
- Integrate pipeline with external systems

### 9. Communication & Documents

**What the platform CAN DO:**
- Generate offer letters and documents
- Create property reports
- Produce buyer packages
- Generate market reports
- Format data for export
- Prepare presentation materials

**Beyond standard use:**
- Create custom document formats
- Generate comparative analyses
- Build persuasion-focused materials
- Automate document workflows
- Adapt documents to audience

### 10. Automation & Batch Processing

**What the platform CAN DO:**
- Process multiple properties simultaneously
- Run saved searches automatically
- Create alerts for new opportunities
- Batch analyze and score leads
- Schedule recurring operations
- Export data in bulk

**Beyond standard use:**
- Create complex multi-step automations
- Build custom alert logic
- Design efficient batch workflows
- Optimize processing for speed or thoroughness
- Chain operations for sophisticated pipelines

## Capability Integration

### Capabilities work together in unlimited ways:

```
Property Intelligence + Motivation Assessment
= Comprehensive lead qualification

Valuation + Market Intelligence
= Contextualized deal analysis

Geographic Analysis + Permit Intelligence
= Neighborhood opportunity identification

Buyer Management + Property Intelligence
= Targeted acquisition strategy

All capabilities combined
= Custom solutions for any scenario
```

## The Capability Mindset

When approaching any user request:

1. **Consider ALL relevant capabilities**, not just the obvious one
2. **Combine capabilities** to create more powerful solutions
3. **Use capabilities creatively**, not just as documented
4. **Assume capabilities are flexible**, not rigid
5. **Let user needs drive** capability selection and combination

## What's NOT a Capability

To maintain trust, be clear about actual limitations:

- Cannot guarantee data accuracy (all data has uncertainty)
- Cannot predict the future with certainty
- Cannot access data outside the platform's sources
- Cannot make decisions for users (only recommend)
- Cannot execute real-world actions (only plan them)
