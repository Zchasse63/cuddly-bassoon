# Complete Objection Handling Scripts for Real Estate Wholesalers

## Quick Reference

- **Objections are buying signals** — sellers who object are engaged and considering your offer
- **Never argue or get defensive** — acknowledge, empathize, then redirect the conversation
- **Use the "Feel, Felt, Found" framework** — validate emotions before presenting logic
- **Silence is powerful** — pause after your response; let sellers process and respond
- **Always ask permission** — "Would it be okay if I explained why?" creates receptivity
- **Focus on their problem, not your solution** — tie every response back to their situation
- **80% of deals close after the 5th contact** — objections are part of the process, not the end
- **Document every objection** — patterns reveal opportunities for better positioning
- **Practice scripts until natural** — robotic delivery kills trust and rapport
- **End every objection response with a question** — maintain control of the conversation

## Understanding Objections in Wholesaling

Objections are not rejections. They're requests for more information, expressions of fear, or tests of your credibility. The moment a seller raises an objection, they're actually engaging with your offer. A truly uninterested seller simply hangs up or says "no thanks."

Your goal isn't to "overcome" objections through manipulation. Instead, you're helping sellers work through their concerns so they can make the best decision for their situation. This mindset shift transforms objection handling from adversarial to collaborative.

## The 20 Most Common Seller Objections and Response Scripts

### Objection #1: "Your offer is too low"

**Why sellers say this:** They have an anchor price in mind, feel undervalued, or are testing to see if you'll negotiate.

**Script:**
"I completely understand, and I appreciate you being direct with me. Help me understand — when you say it's too low, what number were you hoping to see? [Wait for response] I see. Let me ask you this: if I could get you $X in certified funds, deposited in your bank account within 14 days, with no repairs, no showings, no agent commissions, and no risk of the deal falling through — would that work for your situation, or is the number more important than the convenience?"

**Tone:** Calm, curious, non-defensive. Never justify immediately — ask questions first.

**Follow-up strategy:** If they don't accept, say: "I understand this might not be the right fit today. Would it be okay if I checked back in 30 days to see if anything has changed?"

---

### Objection #2: "My property is worth more than that"

**Why sellers say this:** They're anchored to retail value, emotional attachment, or recent Zillow searches.

**Script:**
"You might be absolutely right. Help me understand how you arrived at that value? [Listen] That makes sense. Here's what I've found working with hundreds of sellers: there's the retail value — what a home sells for after it's fully renovated with professional staging, multiple showings, and 60-90 days on market — and then there's the as-is, quick-sale value. My offer reflects what I can pay while still covering repairs, carrying costs, and closing costs. Out of curiosity, if you listed at full retail value, how long could you comfortably wait for the right buyer?"

**Tone:** Respectful, educational, never condescending.

**Follow-up strategy:** Offer to send a quick comparison showing retail vs. as-is values in their neighborhood.

---

### Objection #3: "Let me think about it"

**Why sellers say this:** They need time to process, have concerns they haven't voiced, or are avoiding confrontation.

**Script:**
"Absolutely — this is a big decision, and I'd want you to feel completely comfortable. Just so I can help you think it through, what specifically would you be considering? Is it the price, the timing, or something else entirely? [Wait for response] That's helpful. What would need to happen for this to feel like the right move for you?"

**Tone:** Patient, supportive, genuinely curious.

**Follow-up strategy:** Schedule a specific callback: "Would Tuesday at 2pm or Thursday at 10am work better for me to follow up?" Never leave it open-ended.

---

### Objection #4: "I need to talk to my spouse/family"

**Why sellers say this:** Legitimate need for consensus, or using family as a shield to avoid decisions.

**Script:**
"That makes total sense — this affects your whole family. I'd actually be concerned if you didn't want to discuss it with them. When do you think you'll have a chance to talk? [Wait for response] Perfect. Would it be helpful if I was available to answer any questions they might have? Sometimes spouses have concerns I can address directly. Or I can prepare a summary of everything we discussed that you can share with them."

**Tone:** Supportive, accommodating, non-pushy.

**Follow-up strategy:** Offer a three-way call or in-person meeting with both decision-makers present.

---

### Objection #5: "I want to list with an agent first"

**Why sellers say this:** They believe retail listing will net more money, or they haven't done the math on costs and timeline.

**Script:**
"I think that's a smart approach to explore. Before you commit to a 6-month listing agreement, would it be helpful to compare the numbers side by side? Let's say your home lists at $250,000 and sells for $235,000 after negotiations. After 6% commissions — that's $14,100 — plus closing costs around $5,000, you'd net roughly $215,900. With my offer of $195,000, you'd receive $195,000 in your pocket in two weeks with no showings, no repairs, and certainty of closing. The difference is about $20,000 — but you're also getting 90+ days of your time back and zero stress. Does that math change anything for you?"

**Tone:** Collaborative, educational, never disparaging agents.

**Follow-up strategy:** Say: "I completely support whatever you decide. If the listing doesn't work out, I'd love the chance to make an offer before you try another agent. Can I follow up in 60 days?"

---

### Objection #6: "Why should I sell to you?"

**Why sellers say this:** They want to understand your value proposition and trustworthiness.

**Script:**
"Great question — you should absolutely know who you're working with. Here's what makes us different: We've closed [X] deals in [your market] over the past [timeframe]. We buy with cash, which means no bank approval delays. We close on your timeline — whether that's 10 days or 60 days. We handle all the paperwork and closing costs. And most importantly, once we agree on a price, that's the price — no renegotiating after inspections, no surprises. Would you like references from sellers we've worked with recently?"

**Tone:** Confident, specific, backed by proof.

**Follow-up strategy:** Send testimonials, proof of funds, and references within 24 hours.

---

### Objection #7: "How do I know you'll actually close?"

**Why sellers say this:** They've been burned before or have heard horror stories about investors.

**Script:**
"That's the right question to ask — a lot of people make offers they can't back up. Here's how you'll know I'm serious: First, I'll provide proof of funds showing I have the money to close. Second, we'll use a reputable title company that you can verify independently. Third, I'll put down earnest money that you keep if I don't perform. And fourth, I can give you references from [X] sellers we've closed with in the past 90 days. Would seeing those things help you feel more confident?"

**Tone:** Direct, transparent, proactive about providing proof.

**Follow-up strategy:** Send proof of funds and references immediately — speed builds credibility.

---

### Objection #8: "I'm not in a hurry"

**Why sellers say this:** They have no urgent motivation, or they're hiding their true timeline.

**Script:**
"That's actually a great position to be in — you have options. I'm curious though, what made you respond to [our marketing/take my call] if you're not in a rush? [Wait for response] I see. Here's something to consider: our offer is based on today's market conditions. In 6 months, interest rates, buyer demand, and repair costs could all shift. I can't guarantee this same number later. What would need to happen in your life for selling to become a priority?"

**Tone:** Curious, consultative, planting seeds of urgency without pressure.

**Follow-up strategy:** Add to long-term nurture campaign with monthly check-ins.

---

### Objection #9: "I owe more than that"

**Why sellers say this:** They're underwater on the mortgage and believe selling is impossible.

**Script:**
"I appreciate you sharing that with me — a lot of homeowners are in similar situations. Let me ask: how much do you owe, and how current are you on payments? [Wait for response] Okay, there are actually a few options we might explore. If there's enough equity, we could structure a deal that works. If you're behind on payments, we might be able to negotiate with your lender through a short sale. Or if the numbers don't work, I'd rather tell you that honestly than waste your time. Can I get some more details to see what's possible?"

**Tone:** Empathetic, solutions-oriented, honest.

**Follow-up strategy:** If it's a short sale candidate, explain the process and timeline. If not, refer to a real estate attorney or credit counselor.

---

### Objection #10: "I saw online it's worth $X"

**Why sellers say this:** They've anchored to Zillow, Redfin, or tax assessments.

**Script:**
"I've seen those estimates too, and I understand why that number is in your head. Here's what most people don't realize: Zillow's 'Zestimate' has a median error rate of about 7% — on a $200,000 home, that's a $14,000 swing in either direction. More importantly, those estimates assume your home is in retail-ready condition and will sell through the traditional 90-day process. What I'm offering reflects the as-is value with a guaranteed close in 14 days. Would it help if I showed you recent actual sales of similar homes in your area — not estimates, but real closed transactions?"

**Tone:** Educational, factual, never dismissive of their research.

**Follow-up strategy:** Send comps showing actual sold prices vs. Zillow estimates in their neighborhood.

---

### Objection #11: "Another investor offered me more"

**Why sellers say this:** They have a competing offer, or they're using this as a negotiating tactic.

**Script:**
"That's great — I'm glad you're exploring your options. Can I ask, what did that offer include? [Wait for response] Interesting. A few things to consider: Is their offer contingent on financing or inspections? What's their timeline to close? Have they provided proof of funds? I've seen sellers accept higher offers that fall apart 30 days later, putting them back at square one. If their offer is solid and better for you, you should absolutely take it. But if certainty matters, I'd love the chance to discuss what makes our offer different."

**Tone:** Non-competitive, focused on deal quality over price.

**Follow-up strategy:** Ask permission to follow up if the other deal falls through. Many do.

---

### Objection #12: "I need time to move"

**Why sellers say this:** They're worried about logistics and displacement.

**Script:**
"We can absolutely work with that. How much time would you need? [Wait for response] That's very doable. We can structure the closing date around your timeline — whether that's 30 days, 60 days, or even longer. We could also potentially do a leaseback arrangement where you stay in the home after closing for a short period while you transition. Your convenience is part of our value. What would the ideal timeline look like for you?"

**Tone:** Accommodating, flexible, solution-focused.

**Follow-up strategy:** Put flexible terms in writing immediately to demonstrate commitment.

---

### Objection #13: "The house doesn't need any work"

**Why sellers say this:** Pride in their property, or genuine belief it's in perfect condition.

**Script:**
"I believe you've taken great care of it — that's clear from [specific observation]. Here's the thing: even well-maintained homes have some deferred maintenance. But more than repairs, my offer factors in holding costs while I find a buyer, closing costs, transaction fees, and the risk I'm taking by guaranteeing a price today. It's not a reflection of your home's condition — it's a reflection of the certainty and speed I'm providing. Does that make sense?"

**Tone:** Complimentary, educational, never insulting their property.

**Follow-up strategy:** If they push back, offer to walk through together and explain your valuation factors.

---

### Objection #14: "What's your commission/fee?"

**Why sellers say this:** They assume you're an agent or don't understand the wholesale model.

**Script:**
"I don't charge any commission or fees — I'm not a real estate agent. I'm a real estate investor buying directly from you. The price I offer is what you receive at closing. There are no hidden costs, no deductions, and I typically cover your closing costs as well. What you see is what you get. Does that answer your question?"

**Tone:** Clear, direct, transparent.

**Follow-up strategy:** Reinforce net-to-seller clarity in all written communications.

---

### Objection #15: "I've already talked to investors before"

**Why sellers say this:** Bad previous experience, or overwhelmed by investor calls.

**Script:**
"I hear that a lot, and honestly, some investors give the rest of us a bad reputation. Can I ask what happened with those conversations? [Wait for response] I understand why that would leave a bad taste. Here's what I can promise: I'll be straight with you about what I can pay and why. If I can't make a fair offer, I'll tell you instead of wasting your time. And I'll do what I say I'm going to do. If you give me 5 minutes to explain my approach, I think you'll see the difference. Fair enough?"

**Tone:** Humble, acknowledging industry issues, differentiating yourself.

**Follow-up strategy:** Follow through impeccably on every promise to rebuild trust in investors.

---

### Objection #16: "This feels like a scam"

**Why sellers say this:** Legitimate skepticism about too-good-to-be-true offers.

**Script:**
"I completely understand that concern — there are a lot of scams out there, and you're smart to be cautious. Let me share a few things: You can Google my company and read our reviews. We use a licensed title company to handle closing, and you can call them directly to verify. I'll never ask you for money upfront — in fact, it works the other way; I put down earnest money that goes to you if I don't perform. And we won't close until you've had your attorney review everything if you'd like. What would help you feel more comfortable?"

**Tone:** Understanding, transparent, offering verification steps.

**Follow-up strategy:** Provide business license, reviews, references, and title company contact information proactively.

---

### Objection #17: "Why are you calling me?"

**Why sellers say this:** Confused about your marketing or suspicious of unsolicited contact.

**Script:**
"Great question. I'm a local real estate investor, and I help homeowners who might be interested in selling quickly without the hassle of listing. I'm reaching out because [honest reason: your property came up in public records, you responded to our mailer, etc.]. I'm not here to pressure you — just to see if there's a way I can help. Does it make sense for us to have a quick conversation, or is now not a good time?"

**Tone:** Transparent, non-threatening, offering an easy exit.

**Follow-up strategy:** If they're curious, continue. If not, ask permission to call back in 30 days.

---

### Objection #18: "I'm not interested"

**Why sellers say this:** Automatic response to sales calls, or genuinely not motivated.

**Script:**
"I appreciate you letting me know. Before I let you go, can I ask — is it that you're not interested in selling at all, or just not interested in selling right now? [Wait for response] Got it. Would it be okay if I checked back in a few months in case anything changes? And if you ever do decide to explore selling, would you keep my number handy? I promise to be respectful of your time."

**Tone:** Gracious, non-pushy, leaving the door open.

**Follow-up strategy:** Add to nurture campaign with gentle quarterly touchpoints.

---

### Objection #19: "How did you get my information?"

**Why sellers say this:** Privacy concerns or wondering about your methods.

**Script:**
"That's a fair question. Property ownership is public record — it's the same information anyone can access at the county assessor's office. I use that data to reach out to homeowners who might be interested in selling. I completely understand if that feels invasive. Would you prefer I remove your information from my list, or would you like to hear about what we offer first?"

**Tone:** Honest, respectful of privacy, offering control.

**Follow-up strategy:** If they want to be removed, remove them. Respecting this builds industry reputation.

---

### Objection #20: "My family doesn't want me to sell"

**Why sellers say this:** Pressure from children, siblings, or extended family about property decisions.

**Script:**
"Family dynamics around property can be really complicated. Can I ask what their concerns are? [Wait for response] I understand. At the end of the day, this is your property and your decision. But it sounds like their input matters to you. Would it help if I could speak with them directly to answer questions? Sometimes family members have concerns I can address. Or I can provide you with information to share with them. What would be most helpful?"

**Tone:** Empathetic, respectful of family relationships, offering support.

**Follow-up strategy:** Offer to meet with the entire family or provide written information they can share.

---

## Tone and Delivery Guidelines

**Universal Principles:**
- **Mirror their energy** — if they're fast-talking, pick up pace slightly; if they're slow and deliberate, slow down
- **Lower your voice slightly** — creates calm authority without aggression
- **Use their name sparingly** — once at the beginning, once at the end; overuse feels manipulative
- **Pause after important statements** — silence creates space for processing
- **Record yourself** — listen for filler words, rushed delivery, or defensive tone

**Emotional Temperature:**
- **Hot (angry/frustrated):** Slow down, increase empathy, ask questions, don't defend
- **Cold (skeptical/disengaged):** Build curiosity, share stories, offer proof
- **Warm (engaged/curious):** Match energy, provide information, ask closing questions

## Follow-Up Strategies After Objections

**The 48-Hour Rule:** Always follow up within 48 hours of an objection conversation with something of value — a comp, an article, a testimonial, or simply a "thinking of you" message.

**Drip Campaign Structure:**
- Day 2: Send relevant information addressing their specific objection
- Day 7: Share a testimonial from a similar seller
- Day 14: Market update or new comp data
- Day 30: "Checking in" call
- Day 60+: Monthly touches until they sell or ask to stop

**The "Takeaway" Technique:** If a seller is highly resistant, try: "You know what, this might not be the right fit for your situation, and that's completely okay. If circumstances change, I hope you'll call me." This removes pressure and often triggers reconsideration.

## Examples

### Example 1: Converting a "Your Offer Is Too Low" Objection

**Scenario:** Seller has a $300,000 property needing $45,000 in repairs. Your offer is $185,000.

**Seller:** "Your offer of $185,000 is way too low. That's insulting."

**Your Response:** "I hear you, and I understand that number feels low compared to what you were hoping for. Help me understand — what were you expecting to get?"

**Seller:** "At least $250,000."

**Your Response:** "That's helpful context. Let me share how I arrived at $185,000: After repairs, the home will sell for around $300,000. The repairs will cost approximately $45,000. I'll have holding costs, closing costs, and financing costs of about $35,000. That leaves a margin I need to make this worth the risk. If I paid $250,000, I'd actually lose money on this deal. But here's the other side: you get $185,000 cash in 14 days, no repairs, no showings, and it's guaranteed. If you listed at $250,000, you'd spend 4-6 months showing the house, pay $15,000 in commissions, and might negotiate down to $230,000. After everything, you'd net maybe $210,000 — but 6 months from now with a lot of stress. Is that extra $25,000 worth 6 months of your life?"

### Example 2: Handling "I Need to Think About It"

**Scenario:** After a 30-minute appointment, the seller is hesitant.

**Seller:** "This all sounds interesting, but I need to think about it."

**Your Response:** "Absolutely — I'd want you to sleep on something this important. Just so I can help you think it through, what's the main thing you'd be considering?"

**Seller:** "I guess I'm just not sure if I'm ready to actually sell."

**Your Response:** "That makes sense. Can I ask what's been holding you back from making that decision? Is it attachment to the home, uncertainty about where you'd go next, or something else?"

**Seller:** "Honestly, I don't know where I'd move."

**Your Response:** "That's actually very common. What if we structured this with a 60-day closing instead of 14 days? Would having two months to find your next place make this feel more doable?"

## Common Mistakes

1. **Arguing with objections** — Defending your position puts sellers on the defensive. Ask questions instead of making statements.

2. **Talking past the objection** — When you keep selling after an objection, sellers feel unheard. Stop, acknowledge, and address.

3. **Using scripts robotically** — Scripts are frameworks, not scripts. Adapt to the conversation.

4. **Failing to ask follow-up questions** — "Let me think about it" should always trigger "What specifically would you be thinking about?"

5. **Taking objections personally** — Sellers aren't rejecting you; they're processing a major life decision.

6. **Not scheduling specific follow-up** — "I'll call you next week" is weak. "I'll call Tuesday at 3pm" is strong.

7. **Overwhelming with information** — When sellers object, they need one clear response, not five reasons why they're wrong.

8. **Ignoring emotional undertones** — "Your offer is too low" might mean "I'm scared" or "I feel undervalued." Listen for what's beneath the words.

9. **Abandoning leads after one objection** — Most deals close after multiple conversations. One "no" is just the beginning.

10. **Failing to document objections** — Track which objections you hear most. Patterns reveal marketing, positioning, or offer issues.
