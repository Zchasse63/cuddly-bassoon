# Understanding Real Estate Investor Buyer Types: A Wholesaler's Complete Guide

## Quick Reference

- **Five core buyer types exist**: Flippers, Buy-and-Hold Landlords, BRRRR Investors, Re-Wholesalers, and Institutional/Fund Buyers
- **Flippers need 25-30% margin** after repair costs—they evaluate deals using the 70% rule (ARV × 0.70 - Repairs = MAO)
- **Landlords focus on cash flow metrics**: 1% rule, cap rate (typically 6-10%), and cash-on-cash return (8-15% target)
- **BRRRR investors combine flip and rental criteria**—they need 70-75% ARV after rehab to refinance and pull capital out
- **Re-wholesalers require deeper discounts** (60-65% of ARV minus repairs) to leave room for their assignment fee
- **Institutional buyers trade margin for volume**—they'll pay more per deal but require strict criteria and bulk quantities
- **Match your deal to the right buyer type** to maximize your assignment fee and ensure a successful closing
- **Build relationships with all five types** to have an exit strategy for every deal you encounter
- **Speed requirements vary dramatically**: Flippers close in 7-14 days; institutions may take 30-45 days

## The Five Essential Buyer Types Every Wholesaler Must Understand

Your success as a wholesaler depends entirely on understanding who will buy your deals and what they need to say yes. Every property you contract has an ideal buyer type—sometimes multiple types. Knowing these profiles inside and out allows you to price deals accurately, market them effectively, and close faster.

### Flipper Profile: The Speed-Focused Renovation Investor

#### What Flippers Buy

Flippers purchase discounted properties in fixable condition with clear profit margins after renovation. They target single-family homes, duplexes, and sometimes small multifamily properties that need cosmetic to moderate rehabilitation.

**Typical Price Points:**
- Entry-level markets: $50,000-$150,000 purchase price
- Mid-tier markets: $150,000-$350,000 purchase price
- Higher-end markets: $350,000-$600,000+ purchase price

Flippers generally prefer properties where the all-in cost (purchase plus repairs) stays under $400,000 because buyer pools shrink at higher price points, increasing their risk.

#### How Flippers Evaluate Deals

Flippers use the **70% Rule** as their baseline evaluation formula:

**Maximum Allowable Offer (MAO) = ARV × 0.70 - Repair Costs**

For example: A property with a $300,000 ARV needing $50,000 in repairs:
- $300,000 × 0.70 = $210,000
- $210,000 - $50,000 = $160,000 MAO

This formula builds in approximately 30% gross margin to cover holding costs, financing costs, selling costs, and profit.

**Experienced flippers also calculate:**
- Holding costs: $2,000-$5,000 per month (mortgage, utilities, insurance, taxes)
- Financing costs: 2-4 points plus 10-14% interest on hard money loans
- Selling costs: 8-10% of ARV (agent commissions, concessions, closing costs)
- Target net profit: $25,000-$50,000 minimum on typical deals

#### Speed of Decision Making

Flippers make decisions fast—often within 24-48 hours of receiving deal details. They've analyzed hundreds of deals and know their buy box intimately. When you send a deal that fits their criteria, expect a response the same day.

**Typical Closing Timeline:** 7-21 days with cash, 14-30 days with hard money financing

#### Red Flags Flippers Avoid

- Foundation issues exceeding $20,000 in repairs
- Environmental hazards (mold, asbestos, lead paint in poor condition)
- Unpermitted additions that affect square footage calculations
- Title issues that could delay closing
- Properties in declining neighborhoods
- Deals with thin margins (under $20,000 projected profit)
- Overpriced ARV estimates

### Buy-and-Hold Landlord Profile: The Cash Flow Investor

#### What Landlords Buy

Landlords purchase properties that generate positive monthly cash flow from rental income. They focus on long-term wealth building through appreciation, mortgage paydown, tax benefits, and monthly income.

**Property Type Preferences:**
- Single-family homes in stable neighborhoods
- Small multifamily (2-4 units)
- Properties near employment centers, schools, and amenities
- B and C class neighborhoods with strong rental demand

#### Key Evaluation Metrics

**The 1% Rule (Quick Filter):**
Monthly rent should equal at least 1% of purchase price. A $100,000 property should rent for $1,000+/month.

**Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate):**
Cap Rate = (Net Operating Income ÷ Purchase Price) × 100

Example: Property purchased for $120,000 with $12,000 annual NOI
Cap Rate = ($12,000 ÷ $120,000) × 100 = 10%

Landlords typically target 6-10% cap rates depending on the market.

**Cash-on-Cash Return:**
Cash-on-Cash = (Annual Pre-Tax Cash Flow ÷ Total Cash Invested) × 100

Example: $25,000 total cash invested, $3,000 annual cash flow
Cash-on-Cash = ($3,000 ÷ $25,000) × 100 = 12%

Target range: 8-15% cash-on-cash return

#### Property Condition Preferences

**Turnkey Landlords** want move-in ready properties requiring minimal work before placing tenants. They'll pay more for convenience.

**Value-Add Landlords** seek properties needing light renovation that allows them to increase rents. They'll accept more work for better returns.

#### Areas They Target

- Strong rental markets with low vacancy rates (under 5%)
- Markets with rent-to-price ratios supporting cash flow
- Areas with job growth and population increases
- Neighborhoods with good schools (attracts long-term tenants)
- Locations with landlord-friendly regulations

#### Financing Methods Used

- Conventional mortgages (20-25% down)
- DSCR loans (Debt Service Coverage Ratio loans)
- Portfolio lenders
- Private money
- Seller financing
- Cash purchases followed by delayed financing

**Typical Closing Timeline:** 21-45 days with financing, 14-21 days with cash

### BRRRR Investor Profile: The Hybrid Strategist

#### Understanding the BRRRR Strategy

BRRRR stands for **Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat**. These investors combine flipper execution with landlord ownership goals. They force equity through renovation, then pull that equity out via refinancing to fund the next deal.

#### What BRRRR Investors Need

BRRRR investors require significant forced equity opportunity—the difference between purchase price plus rehab costs and the after-repair value must be substantial enough to refinance and recover most or all invested capital.

**The BRRRR Math:**
- Purchase Price: $100,000
- Rehab Costs: $30,000
- Total Investment: $130,000
- After-Repair Value: $200,000
- Refinance at 75% ARV: $150,000
- Cash recovered: $150,000 - $130,000 = $20,000 (all capital returned plus $20K)

For the strategy to work, they need to purchase at approximately **70-75% of ARV minus repairs**—similar to flipper criteria.

#### Combined Evaluation Criteria

BRRRR investors evaluate deals using both flipper and landlord metrics:

**Flipper Side:**
- Does the deal have enough margin to force equity?
- Can the property be renovated within budget?
- Will the ARV appraise at the projected value?

**Landlord Side:**
- Will the property cash flow after refinancing at 75% ARV?
- Is the neighborhood suitable for long-term rentals?
- What's the realistic rental income post-renovation?

#### Critical Refinance Requirements

The refinance is the linchpin of BRRRR. Most lenders require:
- 6-12 month seasoning period before cash-out refinance
- Verified rental income (lease in place)
- 70-75% loan-to-value maximum
- Property must appraise at target ARV
- Debt service coverage ratio of 1.0-1.25

**Typical Timeline:** 30-180 days from purchase to refinance completion

### Re-Wholesaler Profile: The Deal Distributor

#### What Re-Wholesalers Do

Re-wholesalers buy contracts from other wholesalers and reassign them to their own buyer network. They're middlemen who profit from having deeper buyer relationships or access to different markets.

#### Deep Discount Requirements

Because re-wholesalers must add their own assignment fee on top of yours, they require significantly deeper discounts:

**Typical Requirement:** 60-65% of ARV minus repairs (compared to 70% for end buyers)

Example: $200,000 ARV property needing $40,000 repairs
- End buyer MAO: $200,000 × 0.70 - $40,000 = $100,000
- Re-wholesaler MAO: $200,000 × 0.65 - $40,000 = $90,000

This allows room for both your assignment fee ($5,000-$10,000) and theirs ($5,000-$10,000).

#### Buyer List Depth Determines Success

A re-wholesaler's ability to close depends entirely on the quality and depth of their buyer list. Before assigning to a re-wholesaler, ask:

- How many active cash buyers do you have?
- What's your average close rate on assigned contracts?
- Can you provide proof of funds or earnest money deposit?
- Have you closed deals in this specific area?

#### Speed Focus

Re-wholesalers operate on tight timelines because they're working against your inspection period. They need to:
- Evaluate the deal within hours
- Market to their list immediately
- Secure a buyer within 3-7 days
- Coordinate double closing or assignment

**Typical Timeline:** 7-14 days from contract to close

### Fund and Institutional Buyer Profile: The Volume Operator

#### Who These Buyers Are

Institutional buyers include hedge funds, REITs, private equity firms, and large-scale investment companies purchasing rental properties in bulk. Names like Invitation Homes, American Homes 4 Rent, and Progress Residential operate in this space, along with smaller regional funds.

#### Large Volume Requirements

Institutional buyers prefer:
- Bulk purchases: 5-50+ properties at once
- Consistent product type: 3-bed/2-bath single-family homes
- Specific vintage: Often 1990 or newer construction
- Geographic concentration: Multiple properties in same market

They'll often pass on individual deals but become interested when you can aggregate multiple properties meeting their criteria.

#### Strict Criteria Examples

Typical institutional buy box:
- Built 1990 or later
- 3+ bedrooms, 2+ bathrooms
- 1,200-2,500 square feet
- No HOA or HOA under $100/month
- No pool
- Property condition: Turnkey or light rehab under $10,000
- Specific school district ratings
- Specific neighborhoods (often provided as zip code lists)

#### Different Pricing Expectations

Institutions trade margin for volume. They'll pay closer to market value (80-90% of ARV) because:
- Their cost of capital is lower
- Operational efficiencies reduce per-unit costs
- Scale matters more than individual deal margins

However, they expect volume and consistency in return.

**Typical Timeline:** 30-45 days due to corporate approval processes

## Examples: Matching Deals to Buyer Types

### Example 1: The Cosmetic Fixer

**Property Details:**
- 3-bed/2-bath single-family
- ARV: $250,000
- Repairs needed: $35,000 (cosmetic: paint, flooring, kitchen update)
- Your contract price: $125,000

**Best Buyer Match:** Flipper
- Flipper MAO: $250,000 × 0.70 - $35,000 = $140,000
- Your assignment fee potential: $15,000
- Decision speed: 24-48 hours
- Close timeline: 10-14 days

### Example 2: The Cash-Flowing Duplex

**Property Details:**
- Duplex, both units rented
- Monthly rent: $2,200 total
- Purchase price: $180,000
- Condition: Tenant-ready, minimal deferred maintenance

**Best Buyer Match:** Buy-and-Hold Landlord
- 1% Test: $2,200 ÷ $180,000 = 1.22% ✓
- Cap Rate: ($2,200 × 12 - $5,000 expenses) ÷ $180,000 = 11.8%
- Appeals to: Passive income investors seeking immediate cash flow

### Example 3: The Deep Value-Add

**Property Details:**
- 4-bed/2-bath single-family
- ARV: $320,000
- Repairs needed: $60,000
- Projected rent after rehab: $2,400/month
- Your contract price: $145,000

**Best Buyer Match:** BRRRR Investor
- All-in cost: $205,000
- Refinance at 75% ARV: $240,000
- Capital recovered: $35,000 profit plus original investment
- Post-refinance cash flow: $2,400 rent supports debt service

## Common Mistakes When Working with Different Buyer Types

1. **Sending flipper deals to landlords** - Cash flow investors don't want heavy renovation projects. Match the deal to the buyer.

2. **Overestimating ARV to attract buyers** - Experienced buyers verify comps. Inflated ARVs destroy credibility and kill deals during due diligence.

3. **Underestimating repair costs** - Flippers and BRRRR investors have contractors on speed dial. Low-balling repairs insults their intelligence.

4. **Ignoring buyer's specific buy box** - Institutional buyers won't deviate from criteria. Don't waste time pitching deals outside their parameters.

5. **Assigning to re-wholesalers without vetting** - Verify their buyer list depth and close rate before trusting them with your deal.

6. **Pricing at buyer's MAO** - Leave room for negotiation. Price 5-10% below MAO to create urgency and competitive bidding.

7. **Forgetting holding costs in flip calculations** - A deal that takes 6 months to flip costs $12,000-$30,000 in holding expenses.

8. **Neglecting rental income verification for BRRRR deals** - The refinance depends on proven rental income. Verify market rents accurately.

9. **Treating all cash buyers identically** - A flipper with 20 completed projects evaluates deals differently than a first-time landlord.

10. **Failing to build relationships across all buyer types** - Your buyer list should include all five types to maximize flexibility and deal flow.
