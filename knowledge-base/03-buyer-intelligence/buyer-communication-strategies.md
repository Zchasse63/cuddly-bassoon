# Buyer Communication Strategies: How to Present Deals, Negotiate Prices, and Build Lasting Relationships

## Quick Reference

- Lead every deal presentation with the four critical numbers: ARV, purchase price, repair estimate, and your assignment fee
- Structure deal emails in scannable format—busy investors review 10-20 deals daily and decide within 30 seconds
- Create urgency through scarcity (multiple interested buyers) and deadlines, never through false pressure
- Follow up exactly 2 hours, 24 hours, and 72 hours after initial deal blast for maximum response
- Address the three most common objections: price too high, repairs underestimated, ARV inflated
- Know your walk-away number before any negotiation begins—never negotiate against yourself
- Update buyer preferences quarterly to avoid sending irrelevant deals that damage your credibility
- Build relationships through consistent value delivery, not just deal flow
- Track buyer response rates to optimize your communication timing and format

## How to Present Deals to Buyers

Your deal presentation determines whether a cash buyer responds in minutes or ignores you entirely. Professional presentation separates six-figure wholesalers from those who struggle to close their first deal.

### Lead with Numbers

Cash buyers are numbers-driven investors. They calculate returns before reading anything else. Your deal presentation must open with the four essential figures:

**The Four-Number Lead:**
1. **After Repair Value (ARV):** $285,000
2. **Your Asking Price:** $165,000
3. **Estimated Repairs:** $45,000
4. **Your Assignment Fee:** $15,000 (included in asking price)

This format allows investors to calculate their spread instantly: $285,000 - $165,000 - $45,000 = $75,000 gross profit potential.

Always show the math. Sophisticated buyers will calculate it themselves, but showing your work demonstrates professionalism and builds trust.

### Property Overview Structure

After the numbers, provide essential property details in a scannable format:

**Property Details:**
- Address: 1847 Oak Street, Memphis, TN 38104
- Beds/Baths: 3 bed / 2 bath
- Square Footage: 1,450 sqft
- Year Built: 1978
- Lot Size: 0.18 acres
- Property Type: Single-family ranch
- Current Condition: Vacant, estate sale

Include one sentence describing the opportunity: "Estate sale with motivated heirs, clear title, 30-day close possible."

### Photo Presentation Best Practices

Photos sell deals. Poor photos kill deals. Follow this protocol:

**Required Photos (minimum 15):**
- Exterior: Front, rear, both sides, street view showing neighborhood
- Interior: Every room, including closets and garage
- Problem Areas: Foundation issues, roof damage, water stains, HVAC condition
- Highlights: Original hardwoods, large lot, desirable features

**Photo Rules:**
- Landscape orientation only
- Natural lighting preferred
- Include damage photos—hiding problems destroys credibility
- Label photos clearly (Kitchen, Master Bedroom, Foundation Crack)
- Compress file sizes for easy email delivery

Never use wide-angle distortion that makes rooms appear larger. Experienced buyers recognize this immediately and lose trust.

### Comp Package Requirements

Your comp package validates your ARV and separates you from amateur wholesalers who guess at values.

**Include Three to Five Comparable Sales:**
| Address | Sold Price | Sqft | $/Sqft | Sold Date | Condition |
|---------|------------|------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| 1823 Oak St | $279,000 | 1,380 | $202 | 45 days ago | Renovated |
| 1892 Oak St | $292,000 | 1,520 | $192 | 30 days ago | Renovated |
| 1756 Elm Ave | $275,000 | 1,400 | $196 | 60 days ago | Renovated |

Show your math: Average $/sqft of $197 × 1,450 sqft = $285,650 ARV (rounded to $285,000)

Include a map showing comp locations relative to subject property. Proximity matters—comps within 0.5 miles carry more weight than distant sales.

### Investment Analysis Breakdown

Sophisticated buyers appreciate complete investment analysis:

**Flip Analysis:**
- ARV: $285,000
- Purchase Price: $165,000
- Estimated Repairs: $45,000
- Holding Costs (4 months): $6,000
- Selling Costs (6%): $17,100
- **Net Profit:** $51,900
- **ROI:** 24.7%

**BRRRR Analysis (for rental buyers):**
- Purchase + Rehab: $210,000
- ARV: $285,000
- 75% LTV Refinance: $213,750
- Cash Left in Deal: $0 (infinite returns potential)
- Estimated Rent: $1,650/month
- Cash Flow After Refinance: $285/month

Providing both analyses shows you understand different buyer strategies and increases response rates.

```

## Creating Urgency Without Being Pushy

Urgency works when it's genuine. Fake urgency destroys credibility permanently.

**Legitimate Urgency Tactics:**
- Reference actual competing interest: "Two buyers viewing tomorrow"
- Mention seller deadlines: "Seller needs answer by Friday for estate closing"
- State inspection period timelines: "My inspection period ends Thursday"
- Highlight market conditions: "Last three deals in this area went in 48 hours"

**Avoid These Credibility Killers:**
- "This won't last!" (vague, unprovable)
- Lying about other offers
- Creating artificial deadlines
- Sending the same "urgent" deal repeatedly

The most effective urgency comes from your reputation. When buyers know your deals move fast, they respond faster.

## Handling Buyer Objections

### Objection: "Your price is too high"

**Response Framework:**
```
"I understand—let me walk through my numbers. The ARV is based on [specific comps], repairs are estimated at $45K based on [contractor quote/your walkthrough], and that leaves $75K spread.

What number works for you, and how did you get there? If your ARV or repair estimate differs, I'd love to see your analysis."
```

This response invites dialogue rather than defending your position.

### Objection: "Repairs seem underestimated"

**Response:**
```
"Fair point—repairs can vary based on finish level. My estimate assumes [standard finishes/builder grade/mid-range]. 

What scope are you planning? If you're doing higher-end finishes, you're probably targeting a higher ARV too. Walk me through your numbers."
```

### Objection: "ARV is inflated"

**Response:**
```
"Let me share my comp analysis. I pulled from [MLS/PropStream/county records] within half a mile, similar sqft, and condition. Here are the five I used...

Which comps are you using? Happy to compare notes."
```

### Objection: "I need to think about it"

**Response:**
```
"Absolutely—take the time you need. Just so you know, I have [other buyer] viewing tomorrow at 2 PM. If you want first shot, let me know by tonight. Otherwise, I'll follow up with you after that showing."
```

## Price Negotiation with Buyers

### Know Your Numbers Before Negotiating

Before any negotiation, calculate:
- Your contract price with seller: $150,000
- Your minimum acceptable assignment fee: $10,000
- Your walk-away number: $160,000
- Your ideal price: $165,000

Never reveal your contract price. Your assignment fee is your business.

### When to Stand Firm

**Hold your price when:**
- You have multiple interested buyers
- Your spread is already reasonable (under 10% of ARV)
- The buyer is testing you with a lowball
- You've already provided one price reduction
- The deal will sell without this buyer

### When to Negotiate

**Consider flexibility when:**
- The deal has been sitting 7+ days
- Your assignment fee exceeds $20,000 (you have room)
- The buyer brings cash and can close fast
- Market conditions have shifted since acquisition
- This buyer brings future deal flow potential

### Negotiation Scripts

**Buyer:** "I'll take it at $158,000."

**You:** "I appreciate the offer. My bottom is $163,000, which still leaves you $72K spread. That's a 20% ROI for 90 days of work. Can you make $163K work?"

**Buyer:** "Meet me at $160,000."

**You:** "I can do $161,500 if you sign today and close in 14 days. That's my final number."

Never negotiate against yourself. State your number and wait for their response.

## Building Long-Term Buyer Relationships

The real money in wholesaling comes from repeat buyers. One active buyer who purchases 2-3 deals annually is worth more than 50 tire-kickers.

**Relationship Building Strategies:**

1. **Deliver on Promises:** If you say repairs are $45K, they better be close
2. **Communicate Proactively:** Update buyers on title issues, seller delays, anything affecting the deal
3. **Respect Their Time:** Don't blast deals outside their criteria
4. **Add Value Beyond Deals:** Share market reports, contractor contacts, lending relationships
5. **Follow Up After Closing:** "How did the rehab go? What did final numbers look like?"

**VIP Buyer Treatment:**
Top buyers get early access before blast. Send them deals 24 hours before your main list. This privilege keeps them engaged and responsive.

## Buyer Preference Updates

Outdated buyer criteria leads to ignored emails and damaged relationships. Implement systematic preference updates.

**Quarterly Preference Check Template:**
```
Hey [Name],

Quick update—want to make sure I'm sending you the right deals.

Current preferences I have:
• Location: Memphis, Shelby County
• Price Range: $100K-$200K
• Property Type: SFR, no condos
• Strategy: Flip

Still accurate? Any changes to your criteria or buying volume this quarter?

Also, any neighborhoods you're specifically targeting or avoiding right now?

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

Track preferences in your CRM with fields for: location, price range, property type, strategy (flip/rental/BRRRR), condition tolerance, and last update date.

## Examples

### Example 1: Complete Deal Presentation

**Scenario:** You acquired a 4-bed/2-bath in Atlanta under contract for $185,000. Repairs estimated at $55,000, ARV at $340,000. Your assignment fee target is $18,000.

**Deal Blast:**
```
Subject: DEAL: 4/2 Atlanta Flip - $82K Spread - 2847 Peachtree Rd

Quick numbers:
• ARV: $340,000
• Price: $203,000
• Repairs: $55,000
• Spread: $82,000

Property: 2847 Peachtree Road, Atlanta, GA 30305
4 bed / 2 bath | 1,850 sqft | Built 1985

Bank REO, vacant 8 months. Foundation solid, needs full cosmetic + HVAC replacement.

Photos + comps: [Link]

Showing Saturday 10 AM. First deposit holds it.
```

### Example 2: Successful Negotiation

**Your numbers:** Contract at $185,000, asking $203,000, minimum $195,000

**Buyer:** "I'll do $195,000 but need 21-day close."
**You:** "I can work with $195,000 if we close in 14 days. My seller has a hard deadline."
**Buyer:** "17 days, best I can do."
**You:** "Deal. I'll send the assignment agreement within the hour."

**Result:** $10,000 assignment fee, closed in 17 days, buyer relationship strengthened.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Burying the numbers:** Leading with property description instead of financial analysis wastes buyer time
2. **Hiding your assignment fee:** Transparency builds trust; hiding fees creates suspicion
3. **Sending deals outside buyer criteria:** Nothing damages credibility faster than irrelevant deal blasts
4. **Over-following up:** More than three touches on a single deal becomes harassment
5. **Negotiating against yourself:** Lowering price before buyer counters signals desperation
6. **Inflating ARV:** Experienced buyers verify instantly; getting caught ends the relationship
7. **Poor photo quality:** Dark, blurry, or misleading photos scream amateur
8. **No comps provided:** Forces buyers to do your work; they'll move to wholesalers who provide analysis
9. **Fake urgency:** Lies about competing buyers destroy trust permanently
10. **Ignoring post-close follow-up:** Missing the opportunity to learn and strengthen relationships
