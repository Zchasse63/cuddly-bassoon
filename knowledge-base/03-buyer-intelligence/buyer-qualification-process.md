# The Complete Buyer Qualification Process: How to Vet Cash Buyers and Build a Reliable Buyers List

## Quick Reference

- **Unqualified buyers kill deals**: 60-70% of failed wholesale transactions trace back to buyers who couldn't perform
- **Ask eight essential questions** before adding any buyer to your active list
- **Always verify proof of funds** through bank statements, portfolio lender letters, or title company confirmation
- **Research transactional history** through county records, networking, and direct references
- **Implement a three-tier system** (A, B, C) based on actual closing performance
- **Use the "first deal test"** to validate new buyers before giving them priority access
- **Red flags include**: vague answers, reluctance to provide POF, excessive negotiation after verbal agreement, and no verifiable closing history
- **A-tier buyers** close within 48 hours of receiving deals, provide POF upfront, and maintain 90%+ close rates
- **Document everything**: Track buyer performance metrics to refine your list continuously

## Why Buyer Qualification Matters

Every minute you spend with an unqualified buyer is a minute stolen from your business. Tire kickers don't just waste your time—they destroy deals, damage your reputation with sellers, and drain your emotional energy.

Here's the reality: when you have a property under contract, you typically have 14-30 days to close. If you spend 10 days working with a buyer who ultimately can't perform, you've lost half your timeline. Now you're scrambling to find a backup buyer while your earnest money sits at risk.

**The math is brutal.** Let's say you average one deal per month at a $12,000 assignment fee. If unqualified buyers cause you to lose just two deals per year, that's $24,000 in lost revenue. Proper buyer qualification takes maybe 30 minutes per buyer and can save you tens of thousands annually.

Beyond the financial impact, consider your reputation. When you assign a contract to a buyer who doesn't close, the seller suffers. The title company notices. Word spreads. Your credibility erodes with every failed transaction caused by bringing unvetted buyers to the table.

Qualification isn't about being difficult—it's about being professional. Serious buyers actually respect the process because they know it means you're running a real operation, not wasting everyone's time.

## The Eight Essential Questions to Ask Every New Buyer

When a potential buyer contacts you or you're adding someone to your list, these eight questions reveal everything you need to know about their ability to close.

### Question 1: How Many Properties Have You Bought in the Last 12 Months?

This question establishes experience and activity level immediately. Listen for specifics:

- **Ideal answer**: "I've closed on 8 properties in the last year, mostly in the $80,000-$150,000 range in the Southside neighborhood."
- **Concerning answer**: "I've done a few deals here and there" or "I'm just getting started."

New investors aren't automatically disqualified, but they require extra verification and should be treated as C-tier until proven.

### Question 2: Do You Buy with Cash or Financing?

Cash buyers close faster and with fewer contingencies. However, many legitimate investors use hard money or private lending.

- **Cash buyers**: Can close in 7-14 days typically
- **Hard money buyers**: Usually need 14-21 days for loan processing
- **Conventional financing**: Rarely works for wholesale deals (30-45 days, appraisal contingencies)

Get specific: "When you say cash, do you mean liquid funds in a bank account, or are you using a portfolio lender?"

### Question 3: What's Your Typical Buying Criteria?

Understanding their buy box helps you match deals efficiently:

- **Price range**: "What's your sweet spot and maximum purchase price?"
- **Property type**: "Single-family only, or do you also buy multifamily and commercial?"
- **Bedroom/bathroom count**: "Any minimum requirements?"
- **Location**: "Which specific neighborhoods or zip codes?"
- **Condition**: "Light rehab, full gut renovation, or anything?"
- **ARV range**: "What after-repair value do you target?"

Document these details meticulously. A buyer who wants 3+ bedroom homes under $100,000 in the East End for full renovation is very different from someone seeking turnkey properties under $200,000 anywhere in the metro.

### Question 4: What's the Maximum You Can Close on Right Now?

This reveals their current liquidity and buying capacity:

- "If I brought you three properties that fit your criteria today, could you close on all three?"
- "What's the maximum capital you have available for purchases this month?"

Serious investors know their numbers. If someone says "unlimited" or can't give you a range, that's a yellow flag.

### Question 5: Who Is Your Title Company or Attorney?

Experienced buyers have established relationships:

- **Good sign**: "I use ABC Title Company. Ask for Sarah—she handles all my closings."
- **Concerning sign**: "I'll figure that out when we get to that point."

Bonus: You can call that title company and ask if the buyer has actually closed deals there. Title companies won't share details but will often confirm, "Yes, they're a client of ours."

### Question 6: Are You Making the Decision or Do You Have Partners?

Decision-making authority matters enormously:

- **Sole decision-maker**: Can commit immediately
- **Partnership**: May need partner approval, adding time and uncertainty
- **Fund manager**: May have investment committee reviews

Ask directly: "If I bring you a deal that fits your criteria at the right price, can you give me an answer within 24 hours, or do you need to consult with anyone?"

### Question 7: How Fast Can You Close?

Push for specifics:

- **7 days**: Indicates serious, liquid buyer with systems in place
- **14 days**: Standard for active cash investors
- **21-30 days**: May indicate financing or operational delays
- **"Depends"**: Needs further clarification

The best buyers have closed quickly before and can prove it with their transaction history.

### Question 8: Can You Provide Proof of Funds?

This is the ultimate qualifier. Ask directly:

"Before I add you to my priority list for deals, I need to verify proof of funds. Can you send me a bank statement, letter from your portfolio lender, or other documentation showing available capital?"

How they respond tells you everything:
- **Immediate compliance**: Serious buyer
- **Reasonable hesitation with follow-through**: Potentially serious, verify carefully
- **Refusal or excuse-making**: Remove from active list

## Proof of Funds Verification Methods

Never take proof of funds at face value. Here's how to verify properly:

### Bank Statements

Request statements from within the last 30 days showing:
- Account holder name matching the buyer (or their entity)
- Current balance sufficient for stated purchase capacity
- Account number (at least partial)
- Bank name and logo

**Red flags**: Edited PDFs, screenshots instead of actual statements, statements older than 60 days, or balances that seem inconsistent with stated buying capacity.

### Portfolio Lender Letters

Private and hard money lenders issue pre-approval or commitment letters. Verify by:
- Calling the lender directly (look up their number independently—don't use the number on the letter)
- Confirming the buyer is an active client
- Verifying the approval amount and terms

### Title Company Confirmation

For buyers claiming extensive purchase history, ask their title company:
- "Has [Buyer Name] closed transactions with your office?"
- "Are they in good standing?"

### Third-Party Verification Services

Services like Plaid can verify bank account balances in real-time. Some sophisticated wholesalers integrate these into their buyer onboarding process.

## Transactional History Research

Verify claims about purchase history through these methods:

### County Records Search

Every property sale is recorded with the county. Search for:
- Deeds in the buyer's name or their LLC
- Frequency of purchases
- Types of properties purchased
- Purchase prices (confirms their stated buying criteria)

Most counties offer free online record searches. Spend 15 minutes verifying a buyer's claims before trusting them with your deals.

### Network Verification

The real estate investment community is small. Ask around:
- "Has anyone worked with [Buyer Name]?"
- "Can anyone vouch for [Buyer's LLC]?"

Join local REIA groups, Facebook wholesaling communities, and BiggerPockets forums. Reputation follows investors.

### Direct References

Ask buyers for references from other wholesalers they've purchased from. Then actually call those references and ask:
- "Did they close on time?"
- "Any issues with the transaction?"
- "Would you sell to them again?"

## Red Flags That Indicate Non-Serious Buyers

Watch for these warning signs during qualification:

1. **Vague answers**: Can't specify purchase criteria, price ranges, or recent activity
2. **Reluctance to provide POF**: Makes excuses, delays, or provides suspicious documentation
3. **No verifiable history**: Claims extensive experience but county records show nothing
4. **Excessive questions without commitment**: Asks for addresses, access codes, and detailed analysis but never makes offers
5. **Renegotiates after verbal agreement**: Agrees to price, then tries to reduce after inspection
6. **Unprofessional communication**: Doesn't return calls, misses scheduled viewings, or sends one-word responses
7. **No title company relationship**: Hasn't established basic business infrastructure
8. **Claims unlimited budget**: Real investors know their numbers and limitations
9. **Asks for extended due diligence periods**: Requests 30+ days "to figure things out"
10. **Can't explain their exit strategy**: Doesn't know if they're flipping, renting, or something else

## The First Deal Test Qualification

Before elevating any buyer to priority status, use the first deal test:

### How It Works

1. **Assign a smaller deal first**: Start with a property at lower price point or smaller assignment fee
2. **Set clear expectations**: Communicate timeline, earnest money requirements, and closing date
3. **Observe their behavior**: Note responsiveness, professionalism, and follow-through
4. **Track performance metrics**: Did they close on time? Did they try to renegotiate? How was communication?

### Scoring the Test

Award points based on performance:

| Metric | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Closed on original date | +20 |
| Earnest money deposited within 24 hours | +15 |
| No renegotiation attempts | +15 |
| Responded to calls/texts within 4 hours | +15 |
| Brought their own team (contractors, etc.) | +10 |
| Provided feedback even if they passed | +10 |
| Referred other deals or buyers | +15 |

**Score 70+**: Promote to A-tier consideration
**Score 50-69**: Solid B-tier buyer
**Score below 50**: Keep at C-tier, monitor carefully

## The Buyer Tier System: A, B, C Classification

Organize your buyers list into three tiers based on proven performance:

### A-Tier Buyers (Your Inner Circle)

- Can close in 10 days or less

**Your treatment:**
- First access to all deals matching their criteria
- Exclusive 24-48 hour windows before wider distribution
- Direct phone calls for hot deals
- Willing to hold deals briefly if they need extra time

### B-Tier Buyers (Reliable Performers)

**Characteristics:**
- Closed 1-2 deals with you
- Close rate 70-90%
- Responsive within 24 hours

- Given standard timelines and terms
- Monitored for promotion or demotion

### C-Tier Buyers (Unproven or Problematic)

**Characteristics:**
- New buyers not yet tested
- Buyers who've failed to close previously
- Inconsistent communication

- Unknown reputation

**Your treatment:**
- Last access to deals
- Larger earnest money requirements

- Close monitoring and quick removal if issues arise

## Examples

### Example 1: Qualifying a New Buyer

A buyer named Marcus contacts you from your Craigslist ad. Here's how the qualification call goes:

**You**: "Marcus, thanks for reaching out. Let me ask you a few questions so I can match you with the right properties. How many properties have you bought in the last 12 months?"

**Marcus**: "I've closed on 6 rentals, all in the Riverside area. Mostly 3-bedroom homes between $70,000 and $110,000 purchase price."

**You**: "Great. Are you buying with cash or using financing?"

**Marcus**: "I use a local hard money lender for acquisition, then refinance into conventional loans after renovation."

**You**: "What's the maximum you could close on right now?"

**Marcus**: "My lender has me approved for up to $150,000 per deal, and I have capacity for two simultaneous projects."

**You**: "Who's your title company?"

**Marcus**: "Premier Title on Oak Street. Jennifer handles my closings."

**You**: "How fast can you typically close?"

**Marcus**: "With hard money, I need 14 days minimum for loan processing."

**You**: "Perfect. Can you send me a pre-approval letter from your lender and your last bank statement showing earnest money availability?"

**Marcus**: "Sure, I'll email those over this afternoon."

**Assessment**: Marcus provides specific, verifiable answers. He has a defined buy box, established relationships, and immediate willingness to provide documentation. After verifying his POF and checking county records for his previous purchases, you'd add him as a B-tier buyer pending his first successful closing with you.

### Example 2: Identifying a Tire Kicker

Sarah reaches out expressing interest in buying wholesale deals. Here's how her qualification goes:

**You**: "How many properties have you bought in the last 12 months?"

**Sarah**: "Well, I haven't bought any yet, but I've been studying for about a year and I'm ready now."

**You**: "Are you buying with cash or financing?"

**Sarah**: "I'm planning to use cash, or maybe a hard money loan. I'm still figuring that out."

**You**: "What's the maximum you could close on right now?"

**Sarah**: "I mean, I have access to plenty of capital. My family is wealthy. I could probably buy anything."

**You**: "Can you send me proof of funds?"

**Sarah**: "I'd rather not share my financial documents with someone I just met. Once you show me a deal, I'll prove I can close."

**Assessment**: Sarah has no track record, unclear funding sources, no specific criteria, and refuses to provide POF. She's either a tire kicker or simply not ready. Politely decline to add her to your list: "Sarah, I appreciate your interest. I work with buyers who can provide verified proof of funds upfront. Once you have that documentation ready, feel free to reach back out."

## Common Mistakes

1. **Adding every contact to your "buyers list"**: A list of 500 unqualified names is worthless. Quality trumps quantity.

2. **Taking POF at face value**: Fake POF documents are common. Always verify through secondary channels.

3. **Skipping qualification for "big talkers"**: Buyers who claim to buy 50 houses yearly but can't provide documentation are often the biggest time-wasters.

4. **Not tracking buyer performance**: Without data, you can't identify who actually performs versus who just talks.

5. **Giving A-tier treatment to unproven buyers**: First deals should be tests. Don't give your best opportunity to someone with zero track record with you.

6. **Failing to update buyer criteria**: Investors' situations change. Re-qualify buyers annually.

7. **Ignoring soft red flags**: Small warning signs during qualification often predict major problems during transactions.

8. **Not asking about decision-making authority**: Deals die when your buyer needs to "run it by their partner" who wasn't involved in negotiations.

9. **Accepting "I can close whenever" as an answer**: Real investors have operations, contractors, and schedules. They know their realistic timeline.

10. **Burning bridges over one failed deal**: Sometimes legitimate issues arise. Understand the situation before permanently removing a buyer.
