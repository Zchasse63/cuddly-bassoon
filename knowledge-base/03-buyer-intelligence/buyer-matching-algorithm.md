# Buyer Matching Algorithm: Technical Guide to Matching Deals with the Right Investors

## Quick Reference

- Match deals using a seven-tier criteria hierarchy: location → property type → price range → ARV range → condition tolerance → bed/bath count → exit strategy
- Use a weighted scoring system (0-100 points) to rank buyers against each deal, with must-have criteria as automatic disqualifiers
- Top-performing buyers (90%+ close rate, fast communication) deserve 24-48 hour "first look" periods before broader distribution
- Slightly mismatched deals (80-90% fit) can convert when framed transparently with compelling economics
- Targeted marketing to 5-10 qualified buyers outperforms deal blasting to 500+ contacts in both close rate and assignment fee
- Track buyer criteria changes quarterly—investors' strategies evolve based on market conditions
- Exclusivity arrangements work best with proven buyers who close 3+ deals annually with you
- Never send a deal without checking at least three core criteria: location, price range, and property type

## The Matching Criteria Hierarchy

Successful deal matching requires understanding that not all criteria carry equal weight. Think of buyer criteria as a pyramid—some elements are absolute dealbreakers, while others are flexible preferences.

### Tier 1: Geographic Location

Location is the ultimate gatekeeper. Most buyers have rigid geographic boundaries based on:

**Primary Market Definition**
- Specific zip codes they actively purchase in
- City or neighborhood boundaries they understand
- Drive-time radius from their office or property manager (typically 30-60 minutes)
- School district boundaries (critical for family rental operators)

**Secondary Market Flexibility**
Some buyers expand into adjacent areas for exceptional deals. Track these as "secondary zones" with notation like: "Will consider Clayton County if numbers are 15%+ better than typical."

**Virtual Buyer Considerations**
Out-of-state investors purchasing through property managers have different location criteria—they care more about zip code crime stats, rental demand data, and property management availability than physical proximity.

### Tier 2: Property Type

Buyers specialize by property category:

| Property Type | Typical Buyer Profile | Key Considerations |
|--------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| SFR (Single-Family) | Flippers, BRRRR investors, turnkey operators | Most liquid, broadest buyer pool |
| Small Multi (2-4 units) | House hackers, small landlords | FHA financing possible, premium pricing |
| Large Multi (5+ units) | Commercial investors, syndicators | Commercial financing, higher barriers |
| Land/Lots | Builders, developers, land bankers | Entitlements matter, longer hold periods |
| Mobile/Manufactured | Specialized investors | Park-owned vs land-owned distinction |

Never assume cross-category interest. A buyer who purchases 50 SFRs annually may have zero interest in a duplex regardless of the numbers.

### Tier 3: Price Range

Document buyer purchase parameters with precision:

**Maximum Purchase Price**: The absolute ceiling they'll pay for your assignment
**Preferred Range**: Where they're most comfortable (e.g., "$80K-$120K sweet spot")
**Minimum Deal Size**: Many investors won't bother with deals under $30K-$50K profit potential
**All-In Budget**: Purchase price plus renovation budget combined

Example buyer profile:
- Maximum purchase: $150,000
- Preferred range: $75,000-$125,000
- Minimum profit requirement: $25,000
- Maximum all-in (purchase + rehab): $200,000

### Tier 4: ARV Range

After Repair Value indicates the market segment where buyers operate:

**Low ARV ($75K-$150K)**: Rental-focused investors, Section 8 operators
**Mid ARV ($150K-$300K)**: Mixed flip/rental investors, highest buyer competition
**High ARV ($300K-$500K)**: Experienced flippers with capital access
**Luxury ARV ($500K+)**: Specialized high-end renovators, limited buyer pool

ARV preferences often correlate with financing access. Hard money lenders cap loans at certain ARV thresholds, limiting what buyers can realistically pursue.

### Tier 5: Condition Tolerance

Categorize buyers by their renovation comfort level:

**Turnkey/Light Cosmetic** (Under $15K rehab)
- Paint, carpet, appliances
- Minimal contractor management
- Often newer investors or pure landlords

**Medium Rehab** ($15K-$50K)
- Kitchen and bath updates
- Flooring throughout
- Some systems work

**Heavy Rehab** ($50K-$100K)
- Full interior renovation
- Roof, HVAC, electrical updates
- Experienced contractors required

**Full Gut/Major Structural** ($100K+)
- Foundation issues
- Fire or flood damage
- Complete property reconstruction
- Only seasoned rehabbers with specialized crews

### Tier 6: Bedroom/Bathroom Count

Specific configurations matter for different strategies:

**Rental Investors**: Typically want 3+ bedrooms (2-bedroom rentals attract smaller tenant pool)
**Section 8 Operators**: Often need 3-4 bedrooms for family voucher maximums
**Flippers**: More flexible, but avoid 1-bedroom SFRs in family neighborhoods
**Student Housing**: May prefer multiple smaller bedrooms

Track preferences like: "Prefers 3/2 minimum, will consider 2/1 only if conversion to 3/2 is feasible under $20K."

### Tier 7: Exit Strategy Compatibility

Matching exit strategies prevents deal friction:

**Fix and Flip**: Needs ARV accuracy, comparable sales data, realistic rehab timelines
**BRRRR Strategy**: Requires refinance-friendly ARV, rental income projections
**Buy and Hold**: Focuses on cash flow, cap rate, tenant quality
**Wholetail**: Light cosmetic tolerance, quick-turn retail sale
**Creative Financing**: Subject-to, seller financing, lease-option acceptance

A BRRRR investor may pass on a deal that looks perfect—if the ARV won't support their refinance numbers.

## Scoring Properties Against Buyer Criteria

Create a quantitative matching system that removes subjectivity from buyer selection.

### The 100-Point Weighted Scoring Model

Assign point values based on criteria importance:

| Criteria | Weight | Scoring Method |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| Geographic Location | 25 points | Primary zone = 25, Secondary = 15, Outside = 0 |
| Property Type | 20 points | Exact match = 20, Acceptable alternative = 10 |
| Price Range | 20 points | Within preferred = 20, Within max = 10, Over = 0 |
| ARV Range | 15 points | Within range = 15, Within 10% = 8, Outside = 0 |
| Condition Match | 10 points | Matches tolerance = 10, Slightly over = 5 |
| Bed/Bath Count | 5 points | Matches preference = 5, Acceptable = 3 |
| Exit Strategy | 5 points | Compatible = 5, Workable = 2 |

**Score Interpretation:**
- 90-100: Perfect match—priority notification
- 75-89: Strong match—include in first round
- 60-74: Moderate match—include if deal is exceptional
- Below 60: Poor match—do not send without specific reason

### Must-Have vs. Nice-to-Have Criteria

Some criteria function as automatic disqualifiers regardless of total score:

**Dealbreakers (Zero Score = No Match)**
- Outside any acceptable geographic zone
- Property type they never purchase
- Over maximum purchase price
- Condition exceeds tolerance level

**Weighted Preferences (Partial Credit Acceptable)**
- Slightly outside preferred price range
- One fewer bedroom than ideal
- ARV at the edge of their range

## Multi-Buyer Ranking for the Same Deal

When multiple buyers score similarly, secondary factors determine priority:

### Performance-Based Ranking Factors

1. **Historical Close Rate**: Buyers who close 80%+ of accepted deals rank higher
2. **Speed to Close**: Track average days from contract to closing
3. **Communication Responsiveness**: How quickly they respond to deal notifications
4. **Proof of Funds Verification**: Current, verified funds rank above unverified
5. **Assignment Fee Paid**: Buyers who pay higher fees get priority on competitive deals
6. **Relationship Tenure**: Long-term buyers earn loyalty considerations

### Ranking Formula Example

```
Final Rank Score = Match Score (0-100) + Performance Bonus (0-25)

Performance Bonus Calculation:
- Close rate 80%+: +10 points
- Average close under 21 days: +5 points
- Responds within 4 hours: +5 points
- Verified POF current within 30 days: +5 points
```

## "First Look" Priority for Top Buyers

Your best buyers deserve preferential treatment. Structure first-look agreements carefully:

### First-Look Tier Structure

**Platinum Buyers** (Close 5+ deals/year with you)
- 48-hour exclusive first look on matching deals
- Direct phone call notification
- First right of refusal on specific zip codes

**Gold Buyers** (Close 2-4 deals/year)
- 24-hour early notification
- Email/text notification before broader distribution
- Priority on deals matching exact criteria

**Standard Buyers** (Close 1 deal/year or new)
- Included in general distribution
- No time advantage

### First-Look Agreement Terms

Document these arrangements in writing:
- Geographic exclusivity zones (if any)
- Response time requirements (must respond within window)
- Performance maintenance requirements (minimum annual purchases)
- Termination provisions (30-day notice)

## Presenting Deals That Slightly Mismatch Criteria

An 85% match can still convert when presented correctly.

### Transparency Framework

Never hide mismatches—address them proactively:

**The Mismatch Acknowledgment Script:**
"I know this is slightly outside your typical [zip code/price range/property type], but the numbers on this one are exceptional. Here's why I'm bringing it to you despite the mismatch..."

### Compelling Reasons to Present Mismatches

- Profit margin 25%+ above their typical requirement
- Located adjacent to their primary zone
- Property type they've expressed interest in exploring
- Condition better than typical inventory
- Motivated seller creating unusually flexible terms

### When NOT to Present Mismatches

- Geographic location completely outside their market
- Property type they've explicitly rejected
- Price 20%+ above their maximum
- Condition significantly exceeds their tolerance

## Buyer Exclusivity Arrangements

Exclusivity can strengthen relationships but carries risk.

### Types of Exclusivity

**Geographic Exclusivity**: First right on specific zip codes
**Property Type Exclusivity**: First right on multi-family under 10 units
**Price Band Exclusivity**: First right on deals $100K-$150K

### Exclusivity Requirements

Require performance commitments:
- Minimum purchase volume (e.g., 6 deals per year)
- Response time guarantees (24-hour maximum)
- Verified proof of funds always on file
- Premium assignment fees for exclusive deals

## Deal Blasting vs. Targeted Marketing

Your distribution strategy directly impacts close rates and buyer relationships.

### Deal Blasting

**Definition**: Sending every deal to your entire list simultaneously

**When Appropriate:**
- Time-sensitive deals requiring immediate sale
- New wholesalers building buyer relationships
- Deals with broad appeal (standard SFR, great numbers)

**Downsides:**
- Trains buyers to wait for better deals
- Creates competition that may scare off buyers
- Burns out your list with irrelevant deals
- Reveals your pricing to competitors

### Targeted Marketing

**Definition**: Matching deals to 5-15 specifically qualified buyers

**When Appropriate:**
- Standard operations (90% of your deals)
- Building long-term buyer relationships
- Maximizing assignment fees through perceived scarcity

**Benefits:**
- 3-5x higher response rates
- Stronger buyer relationships
- Higher perceived deal quality
- Protects pricing confidentiality

## Examples

### Example 1: Scoring Three Buyers for One Property

**Property**: 3/2 SFR in zip code 30312, $85,000 purchase, $165,000 ARV, needs $40K rehab

| Criteria | Buyer A | Buyer B | Buyer C |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Location (25) | 25 (primary) | 15 (secondary) | 0 (outside) |
| Property Type (20) | 20 (SFR focus) | 20 (SFR focus) | 20 (SFR focus) |
| Price Range (20) | 20 ($50K-$150K) | 10 (prefers $40K-$80K) | 15 ($75K-$125K) |
| ARV Range (15) | 15 ($100K-$200K) | 8 ($120K-$175K edge) | 15 ($150K-$250K) |
| Condition (10) | 10 (medium rehab ok) | 5 (prefers light) | 10 (heavy ok) |
| Bed/Bath (5) | 5 (wants 3+/2+) | 5 (wants 3+/2+) | 3 (prefers 4 bed) |
| Exit Strategy (5) | 5 (BRRRR) | 5 (flip) | 2 (flip, edge ARV) |
| **Total** | **100** | **68** | **65** |

**Result**: Buyer A receives exclusive first look. Buyer B and C receive notification after 24 hours if Buyer A passes.

### Example 2: Presenting a Mismatch

**Scenario**: Buyer prefers zip codes 30316-30318, but you have exceptional deal in 30319.

**Presentation**:
"Hey Marcus, I know 30319 is one zip code east of your usual zone, but I had to bring this to you. It's a 4/2 with $75K in equity after a $30K rehab. The ARV of $195K is supported by three comps within 0.3 miles. Given your preference for sub-$100K purchases, this $82K contract price fits perfectly. The extra five-minute drive seemed worth showing you first."

## Common Mistakes

1. **Blasting Every Deal to Everyone**: Destroys buyer trust and trains them to ignore your emails
2. **Not Tracking Buyer Criteria Changes**: Investor strategies evolve—update criteria quarterly
3. **Ignoring Past Performance**: A buyer who's passed on 10 deals shouldn't get first look on the 11th
4. **Sending Deals Without POF Verification**: Unverified buyers waste time and kill deals
5. **Treating All Buyers Equally**: Top performers deserve recognition and priority
6. **Not Documenting Criteria Precisely**: "Wants cheap houses" isn't actionable—get specific numbers
7. **Forgetting Exit Strategy Compatibility**: Great flip deals may fail for BRRRR investors
8. **Over-Promising Exclusivity**: Don't offer exclusivity to unproven buyers
9. **Hiding Deal Mismatches**: Transparency builds trust; surprises destroy relationships
10. **Neglecting Secondary Criteria**: Bedroom count and condition tolerance matter for buyer satisfaction
