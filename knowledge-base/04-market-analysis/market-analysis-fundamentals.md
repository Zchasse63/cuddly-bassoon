# Market Analysis Fundamentals for Real Estate Wholesalers

## Quick Reference

- **Median home price trends** tell you where the market is heading—track 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month changes
- **Days on Market (DOM)** under 30 signals a seller's market; over 90 indicates a buyer's market
- **Months of inventory** below 4 months favors sellers; above 6 months favors buyers
- **Sale-to-list price ratio** above 100% means buyers are competing; below 95% means negotiation power
- **Absorption rate** measures how fast inventory sells—essential for timing your exit strategy
- **Active vs. sold ratio** above 4:1 signals oversupply; below 2:1 signals high demand
- Analyze at the **zip code level**, not metro level—wholesale deals are hyperlocal

- Track multiple indicators together—no single metric tells the complete story

## Understanding Market Metrics for Wholesaling

Successful wholesaling depends on your ability to read the market accurately. Unlike retail buyers who purchase based on emotion, you're making business decisions that require data-driven analysis. Every metric you track informs your offer prices, timeline expectations, and profit margins.

### Median Home Price and Trends

The median home price represents the middle point of all home sales in a market—half sell above this price and half sell below. Unlike average prices, median prices aren't skewed by luxury homes or foreclosure sales.

**What to track:**
- Current median price for your target zip codes
- 3-month price change (short-term momentum)
- 6-month price change (medium-term trend)
- 12-month price change (annual comparison)

**How to calculate price trend percentage:**
```
Price Change % = ((Current Median - Previous Median) / Previous Median) × 100
```

For example, if the median price was $250,000 six months ago and is now $265,000:
```
Price Change = (($265,000 - $250,000) / $250,000) × 100 = 6%
```

A 6% increase over six months (12% annualized) indicates a strong seller's market where you'll face more competition for deals but have eager cash buyers.

### Days on Market (DOM)

Days on Market measures how long properties stay listed before selling. This metric directly affects your wholesale timeline and strategy.

**DOM Benchmarks:**
| DOM Range | Market Condition | Wholesale Impact |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| 0-21 days | Hot seller's market | Fast closings, compressed timelines |
| 22-45 days | Balanced to seller's market | Standard wholesale timeline works |
| 46-90 days | Balanced to buyer's market | More negotiation room, patient buyers |
| 90+ days | Strong buyer's market | Aggressive offers, longer holds |

**Pro tip:** Track DOM for your specific property type and price range. A 45-day average DOM for $400,000 homes doesn't help when you're wholesaling $180,000 properties.

### Months of Inventory (Supply)

Months of inventory tells you how long it would take to sell all current listings if no new properties came on the market. This metric reveals supply-and-demand balance.

**Formula:**
```
Months of Inventory = Active Listings / Homes Sold Per Month
```

**Example calculation:**
- Active listings in your target zip code: 85
- Homes sold last month: 17
- Months of inventory: 85 ÷ 17 = 5 months

**Interpretation Guide:**
- **0-3 months:** Severe shortage—seller's market, offer quickly
- **4-5 months:** Balanced market—standard negotiation applies
- **6-7 months:** Buyer's market—more room for aggressive offers
- **8+ months:** Saturated market—significant negotiation leverage

### Sale-to-List Price Ratio

This ratio reveals how much negotiation room exists in your market by comparing final sale prices to original listing prices.

**Formula:**
```
Sale-to-List Ratio = (Average Sale Price / Average List Price) × 100
```

**What the numbers mean:**
- **102%+:** Bidding wars are common—sellers expect above-asking offers
- **98-101%:** Properties sell near asking price
- **95-97%:** Moderate negotiation room exists
- **Below 95%:** Significant price reductions are normal

For wholesalers, a low sale-to-list ratio (below 96%) creates opportunities. Motivated sellers in these markets are more receptive to below-market offers because they've already adjusted expectations.

### Absorption Rate

Absorption rate measures the percentage of available inventory that sells each month. This metric helps you understand market velocity and predict how quickly you can move a deal.

**Formula:**
```
Absorption Rate = (Homes Sold This Month / Active Listings) × 100
```

**Example:**
- 23 homes sold this month
- 115 active listings
- Absorption rate: (23 ÷ 115) × 100 = 20%

**Benchmarks:**
- **Above 25%:** Hot market—inventory sells fast
- **15-25%:** Healthy market—steady movement
- **Below 15%:** Slow market—extended timelines expected

### Active vs. Sold Ratio

This ratio compares current listings to recent sales, providing another angle on market balance.

**Formula:**
```
Active-to-Sold Ratio = Active Listings / Homes Sold (last 30 days)
```

**Interpretation:**
- **Below 2:1:** High demand, low supply—aggressive buying
- **2:1 to 4:1:** Balanced market conditions
- **Above 4:1:** Oversupply—buyer's market

## Buyer's Market vs. Seller's Market Implications

Understanding market conditions directly impacts every aspect of your wholesale business.

### Seller's Market Characteristics and Strategy

In a seller's market, inventory is scarce and buyers compete for properties.

**Market indicators:**
- Months of inventory below 4
- DOM under 30 days
- Sale-to-list ratio above 99%
- Multiple offers are common

**Wholesale strategy adjustments:**
- Increase your MAO (Maximum Allowable Offer) slightly—you're competing
- Reduce assignment fees to move deals faster
- Build deeper cash buyer lists—buyers are hungry
- Focus on off-market acquisition—MLS deals go too fast
- Speed becomes your competitive advantage

### Buyer's Market Characteristics and Strategy

In a buyer's market, inventory exceeds demand and sellers compete for buyers.

**Market indicators:**
- Months of inventory above 6
- DOM exceeding 60 days
- Sale-to-list ratio below 96%
- Price reductions are common

**Wholesale strategy adjustments:**
- Submit more aggressive offers—sellers are flexible
- Negotiate longer inspection periods and extensions
- Increase assignment fees—properties are harder to find
- Target burned-out landlords and tired sellers
- Quality of deal matters more than speed

## How Market Conditions Affect Wholesale Strategy

Your entire business model shifts based on market conditions.

**Pricing adjustments:** In hot markets, work with tighter margins (smaller assignment fees) because deals move quickly. In slow markets, demand larger assignment fees because you're adding significant value by finding a buyer.

**Timeline management:** Hot markets require 14-21 day close cycles. Slow markets allow 30-45 day windows. Structure your contracts accordingly.

**Buyer relationships:** In seller's markets, your cash buyer list becomes your greatest asset—nurture these relationships. In buyer's markets, your acquisition skills matter most.

## Price Volatility and What It Means

Price volatility measures how much home prices fluctuate over time. High volatility markets present both opportunity and risk.

**Calculating volatility:**
Track monthly median price changes over 12 months and calculate the standard deviation. Markets with price swings exceeding 5% month-over-month are considered volatile.

**High volatility implications:**
- Comps become outdated faster—use 30-60 day comps only
- Build larger margins into deals for protection
- Verify ARV immediately before closing
- Cash buyers may hesitate—uncertainty creates fear

**Low volatility implications:**
- 90-day comps remain reliable
- Standard margins work consistently
- More predictable profit calculations
- Easier to build buyer confidence

## Seasonal Patterns in Real Estate Markets

Real estate markets follow predictable seasonal cycles that smart wholesalers exploit.

**Spring (March-May):**
- Highest buyer activity
- Fastest sales velocity
- Most competition for deals
- Ideal time to sell, challenging to buy

**Summer (June-August):**
- Family buyers active before school year
- Strong but slightly declining demand
- Good balance of buying and selling

**Fall (September-November):**
- Declining buyer activity
- Motivated sellers who missed summer rush
- Better acquisition opportunities
- Assignment may take longer

**Winter (December-February):**
- Lowest activity levels
- Most motivated sellers remain
- Best time for aggressive offers
- Smaller but serious buyer pool

**Pro tip:** Track your specific market's seasonal patterns. Phoenix's "winter" is busier than its scorching summer. Northeast markets virtually stop during January.

## Reading Market Direction Indicators

Leading indicators help you anticipate market shifts before they appear in sales data.

**New listing activity:** Rising new listings signal future inventory increases (coming buyer's market). Declining new listings suggest tightening supply.

**Pending sales:** This leading indicator shows contracts signed but not yet closed. Rising pending sales mean future closed sales will increase.

**Mortgage applications:** Track locally if possible. Declining applications predict future demand decreases.

**Building permits:** New construction coming online in 12-18 months affects future supply.

**Interest rate trends:** Rising rates reduce buyer purchasing power and cool demand. Falling rates stimulate buying activity.

## Zip Code Level Analysis vs. Metro Level

Metro-level statistics mislead wholesalers. Your business operates at the neighborhood level, and averages across entire metros hide critical variations.

**Why zip code analysis matters:**
- One zip code might be appreciating 8% while an adjacent one depreciates 3%
- DOM varies dramatically between neighborhoods
- Cash buyer activity concentrates in specific areas
- Rental demand and investor interest vary hyperlocally

**Example contrast:**
A metro area shows 45 DOM average and 5 months of inventory—seemingly balanced. But:
- Zip code 85004: 22 DOM, 2.5 months inventory (hot)
- Zip code 85033: 78 DOM, 8 months inventory (cold)

These require completely different strategies despite being in the same metro.

**Best practice:** Create analysis profiles for each zip code where you actively wholesale. Update monthly using local MLS data, Redfin, or PropStream.

## Examples

### Example 1: Hot Market Analysis

**Market:** Phoenix, AZ - Zip Code 85018
- Median price: $625,000 (up 4% in 6 months)
- DOM: 18 days
- Months of inventory: 1.8
- Sale-to-list ratio: 101.2%
- Absorption rate: 32%

**Analysis:** This is a strong seller's market. Your wholesale strategy should focus heavily on off-market acquisition since MLS properties attract multiple offers. Assignment fees should be conservative ($8,000-$12,000 range) because cash buyers will pay near-market prices. Speed is essential—get contracts signed within 48 hours of seller contact.

### Example 2: Shifting Market Analysis

**Market:** Austin, TX - Zip Code 78745
- Median price: $485,000 (down 2% in 6 months)
- DOM: 52 days
- Months of inventory: 5.8
- Sale-to-list ratio: 96.5%
- Absorption rate: 14%

**Analysis:** This market is transitioning toward buyer's conditions. Sellers are adjusting expectations downward, creating wholesale opportunities. Your offers can be 5-8% more aggressive than six months ago. Assignment fees can increase ($12,000-$18,000) because finding genuine buyers requires more work. Use 30-day inspection periods and negotiate seller concessions.

### Example 3: Seasonal Adjustment

**Scenario:** You're analyzing a deal in Minneapolis in November.
- Current DOM: 45 days
- Historical November DOM: 42 days
- Historical May DOM: 21 days

**Analysis:** The current 45 DOM isn't alarming—it aligns with seasonal norms. However, if you're closing in February, expect even longer buyer search times. Factor 60+ days into your timeline. Spring provides better exit conditions, so consider longer contract periods or adjust acquisition pricing to account for carrying risk.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Using metro-level data for local decisions** – A city-wide average hides neighborhood-specific conditions that directly affect your deals. Always drill down to zip code level.

2. **Relying on single metrics** – DOM alone doesn't tell the story. A 30-day DOM in a declining-price market means something different than 30-day DOM in an appreciating market.

3. **Ignoring seasonal context** – A 60-day DOM in January might be normal; in May, it signals problems. Compare current metrics to historical seasonal patterns.

4. **Using outdated comps in volatile markets** – When prices shift quickly, 90-day-old sales mislead. In volatile markets, prioritize the most recent 30-45 days of data.

5. **Overlooking new construction impact** – Large developments coming online flood specific zip codes with inventory. Check building permits and planned communities.

6. **Assuming past performance continues** – Markets shift. The zip code that appreciated 15% last year may flatten or decline. Track leading indicators, not just historical data.

7. **Ignoring price point variations** – Entry-level homes and luxury homes behave differently in the same market. Analyze metrics for your target price range specifically.

8. **Forgetting investor-specific metrics** – Retail buyer activity differs from cash buyer activity. Track investor purchases separately if your MLS allows filtering.

9. **Analysis paralysis** – Spending weeks analyzing when you should be making offers. Set a weekly analysis routine and act on your conclusions.

10. **Not updating analysis monthly** – Markets change. Your January analysis is irrelevant by April. Schedule monthly metric reviews for your active zip codes.
