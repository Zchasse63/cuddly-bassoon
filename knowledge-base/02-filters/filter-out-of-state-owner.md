# Out-of-State Owner Filter: Finding Motivated Sellers Managing Properties from Afar

## Quick Reference

- **Definition**: Property owners whose mailing address is in a different state than the subject property
- **Competition Level**: MODERATE-HIGH — widely used but still effective with proper positioning
- **Motivation Driver**: Distance creates management burden, communication difficulties, and emotional disconnection from the property
- **Key Distinction**: More specific than general absentee owner filter — focuses exclusively on owners 1,000+ miles away
- **Best Response Rates**: When combined with additional distress indicators like tax delinquency, code violations, or vacant properties
- **Pricing Advantage**: Out-of-state owners accept 10-20% below market value for simplicity and speed
- **Contact Timing**: Adjust outreach for the owner's local time zone, not the property's location
- **Two Owner Types**: Intentional out-of-state investors (less motivated) vs. accidental out-of-state owners (highly motivated)
- **Winning Approach**: Lead with convenience and local expertise — position yourself as the solution to their distance problem
- **Optimal Stacking**: Combine with high equity (40%+), long-term ownership (7+ years), and property condition indicators

## Understanding the Out-of-State Owner Filter

### What Defines an Out-of-State Owner?

An out-of-state owner is any property owner whose mailing address—where they receive tax bills, correspondence, and official documents—is located in a different state than the property itself. This filter identifies owners who are physically separated from their property by significant geographic distance.

In practical terms, you're looking for situations like:
- A property in Phoenix, Arizona with the owner's mailing address in Seattle, Washington
- A rental home in Atlanta, Georgia owned by someone living in Chicago, Illinois
- An inherited property in Cleveland, Ohio with the owner residing in Los Angeles, California

Data providers and county records make this information readily available because tax assessors maintain both the property address and the owner's mailing address separately.

### How This Differs from General Absentee Owner Filtering

The absentee owner filter casts a wider net—it includes anyone who doesn't live at the property, whether they're 5 miles away or 5,000 miles away. The out-of-state owner filter is a more refined subset that specifically targets owners separated by state lines.

Here's why the distinction matters:

**General Absentee Owner**:
- Lives in the same city but different address
- Could be a local landlord with multiple properties
- Has easy access to check on property, meet contractors, handle issues
- Likely familiar with local market conditions

**Out-of-State Owner**:
- Lives hundreds or thousands of miles away
- Cannot easily visit the property
- Relies entirely on third parties for information
- Often unfamiliar with current local market conditions
- Faces significant travel costs for any property visit

While both filters identify potential motivated sellers, the out-of-state owner filter targets a group with amplified challenges that create stronger motivation.

## Why Distance Amplifies Motivation

### The Challenge of Managing from 1,000+ Miles Away

Managing a property from across the country fundamentally changes the ownership experience. What seems like a passive investment becomes an ongoing source of stress when you can't simply drive by and check on things.

Consider the practical challenges:

**Physical Impossibility of Quick Response**: When a tenant calls at 10 PM about a burst pipe, an out-of-state owner can't drive over to assess the damage. They're entirely dependent on others—property managers, contractors, or the tenant themselves—to accurately describe the situation and handle it appropriately.

**Travel Cost Reality**: A round-trip flight from California to Texas costs $400-600. Add hotel, rental car, and lost wages, and a single property visit easily reaches $800-1,200. When an owner needs to make three or four trips per year for maintenance issues, turnovers, or inspections, they're spending $3,000-5,000 annually just on travel.

**Contractor Coordination Nightmare**: Finding reliable contractors is difficult even for local owners. From 1,500 miles away, you're essentially hiring people you've never met based on phone calls and Yelp reviews. The potential for being overcharged or receiving substandard work multiplies dramatically.

### Time Zone Challenges for Management

Time zone differences create practical communication barriers that compound daily frustrations.

An owner in New York (Eastern Time) managing a property in California (Pacific Time) deals with this reality:
- When the owner finishes work at 5 PM Eastern, it's only 2 PM Pacific
- Emergency calls come at inconvenient hours
- Coordinating with contractors means either calling during work hours or waiting until evening
- Tenant communication windows shrink significantly

For owners spanning three time zones (3-hour difference), these challenges are manageable but annoying. For owners managing properties from the East Coast to Hawaii (5-6 hour difference), scheduling any live communication becomes a genuine logistical problem.

### Market Unfamiliarity as a Pain Point

Real estate markets evolve constantly. Neighborhood dynamics shift, rental rates fluctuate, and property values change based on local factors that out-of-state owners simply cannot track.

Common market unfamiliarity issues include:

- **Incorrect Rent Pricing**: An owner who moved away five years ago may be charging $1,200/month when market rates have increased to $1,500, leaving $3,600 annually on the table—or conversely, charging above market and wondering why they can't keep tenants
- **Neighborhood Decline Awareness**: Local owners notice when businesses close, crime increases, or demographics shift. Out-of-state owners often remain oblivious until problems become severe
- **Repair Cost Calibration**: Without local knowledge, owners can't evaluate whether a $3,500 roof repair quote is reasonable or inflated
- **Sale Timing**: Out-of-state owners frequently miss optimal selling windows because they're disconnected from local market momentum

### The "I Can't Deal with This Anymore" Breaking Point

Every out-of-state owner has a breaking point—a moment when the cumulative stress, financial drain, and emotional exhaustion overwhelm any attachment to the property.

This breaking point typically arrives after a sequence of events:

1. **Initial Tolerance**: Owner accepts minor inconveniences as part of ownership
2. **Growing Frustration**: Problems accumulate—late rent, maintenance calls, difficult tenants
3. **Financial Stress**: Unexpected repairs drain reserves, property management fees eat into returns
4. **Emotional Exhaustion**: Every phone call from that area code triggers anxiety
5. **Breaking Point**: One final incident—a $4,000 HVAC failure, a tenant eviction, a major code violation—pushes them over the edge

Your marketing should reach owners somewhere between stages 3-5. By the time they hit the breaking point, they want out immediately and will prioritize speed and certainty over maximum price.

## Common Out-of-State Owner Scenarios

Understanding why someone became an out-of-state owner helps you tailor your approach and assess their likely motivation level.

### Inherited Property Owners

**Scenario**: Sarah in Boston inherited her father's house in Memphis when he passed away last year. She's never lived in Memphis, has no connection to the city, and now owns a 1970s ranch home that needs updating.

**Motivation Factors**:
- Emotional burden of dealing with deceased parent's property
- No personal attachment to the property or area
- Unfamiliar with local market, contractors, and processes
- Often needs to split proceeds with siblings
- Property may have deferred maintenance from elderly owner

**Typical Timeline**: Highly motivated within 6-18 months of inheritance, urgency increases around probate completion

### Work Relocation Keepers

**Scenario**: Michael relocated from Phoenix to Denver for a job promotion. Rather than selling his Phoenix home, he decided to rent it out. Two years later, he's exhausted from long-distance management and poor tenant experiences.

**Motivation Factors**:
- Originally kept property expecting to return (often doesn't happen)
- Rental income not meeting expectations after expenses
- Tired of being a landlord from 600+ miles away
- May have negative equity concerns from recent market shifts

**Typical Timeline**: Motivation peaks after 2-4 years of remote ownership or after second tenant turnover

### Former Primary Residence Owners

**Scenario**: The Johnsons retired and moved from Chicago to Florida. They kept their Chicago home as a rental for income, but Chicago winters mean tenant heating complaints, frozen pipe risks, and snow removal coordination—all impossible to manage from Miami.

**Motivation Factors**:
- Strong original attachment makes initial selling difficult
- Reality of management eventually overcomes sentiment
- Fixed income in retirement makes unexpected repairs particularly painful
- May have substantial equity from decades of ownership

**Typical Timeline**: Usually ready to sell within 3-5 years of relocation

### Failed Investment Property Owners

**Scenario**: During the 2020-2021 market, Jennifer bought an investment property in Austin from her home in Ohio, attracted by appreciation potential. Returns haven't met expectations, and managing from 1,200 miles away has been harder than projected.

**Motivation Factors**:
- Investment thesis hasn't played out
- Management costs exceeded projections
- Distance makes optimization impossible
- Ready to cut losses and move on

**Typical Timeline**: Highly variable—depends on financial situation and stubbornness

## Two Types of Out-of-State Owners: Critical Distinction

### Intentional Out-of-State Investors

These owners deliberately purchased properties outside their home state as investment vehicles. They may own multiple out-of-state properties, have established property management relationships, and view ownership purely as a financial decision.

**Characteristics**:
- Often own multiple properties
- Have existing property management infrastructure
- View properties as spreadsheet line items
- Less emotionally attached
- More sophisticated about pricing

**Motivation Level**: LOW to MODERATE — They're designed for this, but may sell underperforming assets

**Your Approach**: Focus on portfolio simplification, capital reallocation opportunities, and market timing. These are business conversations.

### Accidental Out-of-State Owners

These owners became out-of-state landlords through circumstances rather than intention—inheritance, job relocation, or keeping a former home. They never planned to manage property remotely.

**Characteristics**:
- Usually own single out-of-state property
- No established management systems
- High emotional connection (positive or negative) to property
- Often underpriced or poorly managed
- Limited real estate sophistication

**Motivation Level**: MODERATE to EXTREMELY HIGH — They're not equipped for this and often want out

**Your Approach**: Lead with empathy and convenience. Emphasize simplicity and problem-solving. These are emotional conversations.

The accidental out-of-state owner represents your best opportunity within this filter.

## Approach Strategies That Work

### Emphasize Convenience and Local Expertise

Your core message to out-of-state owners should address their primary pain points: distance and unfamiliarity.

**Effective Positioning Language**:

"I understand that managing a property from [their state] isn't easy. As a local buyer here in [property city], I can handle everything—inspections, paperwork, coordination—so you don't have to make another trip."

"I've worked with several out-of-state owners who were relieved to have someone local handle the entire process. From inspecting the property to coordinating with the title company, I take care of everything here."

"You won't need to fly out, coordinate with contractors, or deal with showings. I buy properties as-is, which means you can sell without any repairs or updates."

### Position Yourself as the Solution to Their Distance Problem

Every communication should reinforce that working with you solves their fundamental challenge—being too far away to effectively handle this property.

**Key Messaging Points**:
- You handle all local logistics
- No property visits required from them
- As-is purchase eliminates repair coordination
- Quick, certain close removes ongoing management burden
- Local expertise means they get fair, informed offers

### Why They Accept Lower Prices for Simplicity

Out-of-state owners frequently accept 10-20% below full retail market value. Understanding why helps you frame your offers appropriately.

**Value Proposition Calculation**:

For an out-of-state owner with a property worth $250,000 retail:

Traditional Sale Costs:
- Real estate commission: $15,000 (6%)
- Pre-sale repairs: $12,000 (typical aging property)
- Staging/preparation: $2,000
- Travel for showings/closing: $1,500
- Carrying costs during 60-90 day marketing: $4,000
- Stress and time: Incalculable but real

**Total: $34,500+ in direct costs, plus 3-4 months of continued ownership stress**

Your cash offer at $205,000 (18% below retail):
- Net to seller: $205,000
- No repair costs
- No commissions
- No travel
- Close in 14-21 days
- Complete certainty

**Real Net Difference**: Perhaps $10,000-15,000 less than perfect traditional sale scenario, but months of freedom earlier and zero hassle

When you present it this way, your below-market offer becomes compelling.

## Best Contact Methods and Timing

### Contact Methods by Effectiveness

**1. Direct Mail (Primary Method)**
Out-of-state owners check their mail at their actual residence, making direct mail highly reliable. Personalized letters outperform postcards for this audience.

**Effective Mail Elements**:
- Reference the specific property address
- Mention you're a local buyer
- Emphasize convenience and no travel required
- Include multiple contact methods

**2. Phone Calls (High Conversion)**
When you reach out-of-state owners by phone, conversion rates often exceed other seller categories because they appreciate someone local taking initiative.

**3. Text Messaging (Modern Approach)**
Text allows owners to respond on their schedule across time zones without the pressure of a live call.

**4. Email (Supplementary)**
Useful for follow-up and sending detailed information, but rarely effective as initial contact.

### Time Zone Optimization

Always call based on the owner's time zone, not the property location.

**Optimal Call Times** (in owner's local time):
- 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM (late morning)
- 4:00 PM - 7:00 PM (after work hours)
- Saturday 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM

**Example Calculation**: For a property in Phoenix (Mountain Time) with an owner in New York (Eastern Time), call between 6:00 PM - 9:00 PM Phoenix time to reach them during 8:00 PM - 11:00 PM Eastern, or adjust for their Saturday morning.

### Follow-Up Sequence

Out-of-state owners often need multiple touches because they're disconnected from the property and may not be actively thinking about selling.

**Recommended Sequence**:
- Day 1: Initial mail piece
- Day 7: Phone call attempt #1
- Day 10: Text message
- Day 14: Phone call attempt #2
- Day 30: Second mail piece
- Day 45: Phone call attempt #3

## Competition Analysis: MODERATE-HIGH

### Why Competition Is Elevated

The out-of-state owner filter is well-known among wholesalers, investors, and iBuyers. Most data platforms prominently feature this filter, making it easy for competitors to target the same list.

**Competition Factors**:
- Easy to pull from any data provider
- Widely taught in wholesaling education
- iBuyers actively target this demographic
- Real estate agents recognize the opportunity

### How to Stand Out

**1. Stack Additional Filters**
Combine out-of-state ownership with:
- High equity (40%+)
- Long-term ownership (7+ years)
- Vacant property indicators
- Tax delinquency
- Code violations

Each additional filter reduces competition while increasing motivation likelihood.

**2. Emphasize Local Expertise**
Your competitors may be other out-of-state buyers. Position your local presence as an advantage.

**3. Speed of Follow-Up**
Many wholesalers send mail but never follow up. Consistent, multi-channel follow-up separates you from single-touch competitors.

**4. Professional Presentation**
Quality mail pieces, professional phone manner, and responsive communication signal legitimacy to skeptical owners who receive multiple solicitations.

## Examples

### Example 1: The Inherited Property Conversion

**Situation**: Robert in San Diego inherited his grandmother's home in Indianapolis when she passed. The 1,800 sq ft ranch had been well-maintained but hadn't been updated since 1995.

**Property Details**:
- Estimated ARV: $185,000
- Needed updates: Kitchen, bathrooms, flooring ($35,000)
- Tax-assessed value: $142,000
- Free and clear (no mortgage)

**Robert's Challenges**:
- Knew nothing about Indianapolis real estate
- Couldn't take time off to fly out and manage contractors
- Had two siblings expecting their inheritance share
- Property sat vacant with ongoing insurance and utility costs

**Your Approach**: Emphasized local expertise, offered to handle everything including estate-related coordination, and presented a clean, cash offer.

**Outcome**: Purchased at $125,000 (32% below ARV). Robert accepted because you handled all local logistics, closed in 18 days, and eliminated his ongoing carrying costs and stress. His share allowed him to pay off credit card debt without a single trip to Indianapolis.

### Example 2: The Exhausted Remote Landlord

**Situation**: Amanda in Boston had kept her Phoenix townhouse as a rental after relocating for a job four years ago. After three tenant turnovers, two evictions, and a recent $6,800 HVAC replacement, she was done.

**Property Details**:
- Estimated ARV: $320,000
- Current condition: Good (recent repairs)
- Remaining mortgage: $195,000
- Monthly management cost: $185 (property management)

**Amanda's Pain Points**:
- Lost $4,200 in vacancy and turnover costs in 18 months
- Couldn't find reliable property management
- Dreaded every call from Arizona area codes
- Cash flow barely positive after management fees

**Your Approach**: Acknowledged her frustration, emphasized immediate freedom from management burden, and positioned your offer as the end of her Phoenix headaches.

**Outcome**: Purchased at $275,000 (14% below ARV). Amanda netted $78,000 after mortgage payoff—less than she might have gotten through traditional sale, but she closed in 16 days without another hour of Phoenix property management.

### Example 3: The Accidental Out-of-State Investor

**Situation**: Tom in Ohio bought a rental property in Austin in 2021 for $380,000, attracted by market appreciation stories. By 2024, appreciation had slowed, management had been challenging, and he wanted to reallocate capital.

**Property Details**:
- Current market value: $395,000
- Purchase price: $380,000
- Remaining mortgage: $355,000
- Monthly cash flow: -$200 (negative)

**Tom's Reality**:
- Appreciation thesis hadn't materialized as hoped
- Property was cash-flow negative after all expenses
- Couldn't optimize operations from 1,200 miles away
- Wanted capital for local investment opportunities

**Outcome**: This deal didn't work. Tom had minimal equity and couldn't accept below-market pricing. Sometimes out-of-state owners don't have enough motivation or equity for wholesale deals. Recognize when to move on.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Treating All Out-of-State Owners Identically
**Mistake**: Using the same approach for intentional investors and accidental owners.
**Solution**: Identify which type you're dealing with early and adjust your messaging accordingly.

### 2. Calling at Wrong Times
**Mistake**: Calling based on property time zone instead of owner's location.
**Solution**: Always look up the owner's mailing address time zone and call during appropriate hours for their location.

### 3. Ignoring the Emotional Component
**Mistake**: Leading with price and terms for inherited or former-residence properties.
**Solution**: Acknowledge the emotional aspects first, build rapport, then discuss business.

### 4. Underestimating Competition
**Mistake**: Assuming out-of-state owners don't receive other offers.
**Solution**: Differentiate through local expertise, professional presentation, and consistent follow-up.

### 5. Not Stacking Filters
**Mistake**: Targeting all out-of-state owners without additional qualification.
**Solution**: Combine with equity requirements, ownership duration, and property condition indicators.

### 6. Failing to Emphasize Convenience
**Mistake**: Focusing only on price in your value proposition.
**Solution**: Lead with convenience, time savings, and simplicity—then support with fair pricing.

### 7. Giving Up Too Early
**Mistake**: Single-touch outreach with no follow-up.
**Solution**: Out-of-state owners are disconnected from their property. Multiple touches across months may be needed to reach them at the right moment.

### 8. Poor Skip Tracing
**Mistake**: Accepting that mailing address is only contact option.
**Solution**: Invest in quality skip tracing to obtain phone numbers and email addresses for multi-channel outreach.

### 9. Neglecting Property Condition Assessment
**Mistake**: Making offers without understanding actual property condition.
**Solution**: Drive the property, talk to neighbors, or use local contacts to assess condition before offering.

### 10. Misreading Investor Sophistication
**Mistake**: Using emotional appeals with sophisticated out-of-state investors.
**Solution**: Match your approach to their sophistication level—numbers-focused for investors, convenience-focused for accidental owners.
