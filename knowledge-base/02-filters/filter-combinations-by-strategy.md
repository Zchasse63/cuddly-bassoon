# Filter Combinations by Investment Strategy: Complete Guide to Targeted Lead Generation

## Quick Reference

- **Wholesale deals** require high-equity filters (40%+) combined with motivation indicators like tax delinquency, vacancy, and out-of-state ownership
- **Subject-to deals** target low-equity situations (under 20%) with distressed circumstances like pre-foreclosure or recent purchase
- **Seller financing** opportunities concentrate among free-and-clear owners with long ownership duration (10+ years)
- **Probate deals** require stacking estate ownership, out-of-state heirs, and long ownership indicators
- **Rental portfolio building** focuses on cash-flow neighborhoods, 3+ bedrooms, and assumable loan opportunities
- **Fix-and-flip acquisitions** combine high equity with property condition indicators like code violations and vacancy
- **Land deals** prioritize tax delinquency, out-of-state ownership, and parcels with development potential
- **Multi-family acquisition** filters emphasize owner-operator burnout indicators and deferred maintenance signals
- Your **exit strategy** determines which filters matter most—always start with your buyer's criteria
- **Buyer list matching** means reverse-engineering filter combinations from what your buyers actually purchase

## Understanding Strategy-Based Filter Selection

Every investment strategy attracts different seller profiles with distinct motivations. A wholesaler hunting quick assignment deals needs distressed, high-equity sellers who prioritize speed over price. A creative finance specialist targeting subject-to deals needs motivated sellers with existing financing they're willing to transfer. Your filter combinations must align with your strategy, or you'll spend money marketing to people who can't—or won't—do your type of deal.

Think of filter combinations as a recipe. Individual ingredients (single filters) produce mediocre results. The magic happens when you combine complementary filters that compound probability. A vacant property alone might generate a 2% response rate. Add out-of-state ownership and tax delinquency, and that rate can climb to 8-12%. Each additional relevant filter narrows your list while dramatically increasing motivation density.

## Wholesale Deals: Quick Assignment Filter Combinations

Wholesale assignments require motivated sellers with sufficient equity to allow room for your fee and your buyer's profit. Speed matters—your sellers need to close quickly, and your buyers expect immediate opportunity.

### Primary Wholesale Filter Stack

**Core Equity Requirement**: 40%+ equity minimum (50%+ preferred)
- Properties worth $200,000 with $80,000 or less in liens
- Free-and-clear properties provide maximum flexibility
- High equity enables aggressive discount negotiations

**Motivation Layer 1** (choose 2-3):
- Tax delinquent (1+ years behind)
- Code violations (active, unresolved)
- Pre-foreclosure/Notice of Default
- Vacant property (6+ months)

**Motivation Layer 2** (choose 1-2):
- Out-of-state owner
- Absentee owner (different address)
- Ownership duration 7+ years
- Multiple property owner with distressed indicators

### Example Wholesale Filter Combination

**Market**: Phoenix, Arizona
**Target**: Single-family homes, 3+ bedrooms, built 1970-2005
**Filters Applied**:
- Estimated equity: 50%+
- Tax status: Delinquent 2+ years
- Property status: Vacant
- Owner address: Out-of-state

**Results**: 847 properties (from 185,000+ in market)
**Response rate projection**: 6-9%
**Expected contracts per 1,000 mailers**: 3-5

This combination identifies owners facing tax sale timelines, no longer residing in the property, and living far enough away that management becomes burdensome. These sellers prioritize speed and certainty over maximum price.

## Subject-To Deals: Creative Financing Filter Combinations

Subject-to acquisitions target sellers who need relief from mortgage payments without sufficient equity for traditional sales. You're solving a payment problem, not extracting equity.

### Primary Subject-To Filter Stack

**Core Equity Requirement**: 0-20% equity (or underwater)
- Recently purchased (2015-2023)
- High loan-to-value (80%+)
- Properties where traditional sale would net seller minimal proceeds

**Motivation Layer 1** (critical):
- Pre-foreclosure/Notice of Default
- Recent job loss indicators (unemployment areas)
- Divorce filing records
- Military orders (PCS relocation)

**Motivation Layer 2** (enhancing):
- Listed and expired (30-90 days ago)
- Recent listing cancellation
- High days-on-market properties currently listed

### Example Subject-To Filter Combination

**Market**: Atlanta, Georgia
**Target**: Single-family homes, $250,000-$450,000 ARV
**Filters Applied**:
- Estimated equity: Under 15%
- Purchase date: 2020-2022 (low interest rate loans)
- Status: Pre-foreclosure or 60+ days delinquent
- Owner: Still occupied (not abandoned)

**Results**: 1,247 properties
**Response rate projection**: 4-7%
**Expected conversations per 1,000 contacts**: 40-70

Sellers in this category purchased during the 2020-2022 low-rate period. Their existing loans carry 2.5-4% interest rates—valuable financing you can assume. They need payment relief more than cash at closing.

## Seller Financing Opportunities: Owner-Carried Note Combinations

Seller financing requires finding owners without existing mortgage obligations who might benefit from monthly income rather than lump-sum proceeds. Target retirees, inheritors, and long-term owners.

### Primary Seller Financing Filter Stack

**Core Ownership Requirement**: Free and clear (no mortgage)
- Ownership duration 10+ years
- Paid-off properties (no active liens)
- Inherited properties (often free-and-clear)

**Owner Profile Layer**:
- Owner age: 55+ (retirees seeking income)
- Multiple property owner (portfolio tired)
- Out-of-state owner (management fatigue)
- Trust-owned property (estate planning active)

**Motivation Indicators**:
- Property tax increases (fixed-income stress)
- Deferred maintenance visible (tired landlord)
- Long-term rental (landlord burnout)

### Example Seller Financing Filter Combination

**Market**: Central Florida
**Target**: Single-family rentals, $150,000-$300,000
**Filters Applied**:
- Mortgage status: Free and clear
- Ownership duration: 15+ years
- Owner type: Individual (not corporate)
- Property use: Non-owner occupied (rental)
- Owner age: 60+

**Results**: 623 properties
**Response rate projection**: 3-5%
**Seller financing acceptance rate**: 15-25% of motivated contacts

These owners have no mortgage requiring payoff. They've managed rentals for decades and often welcome monthly income without management hassle. Offer terms that exceed CD rates while providing them passive income.

## Probate Deals: Estate-Based Filter Combinations

Probate situations involve inherited properties where heirs often prefer quick liquidation over managing unfamiliar real estate. These deals require sensitivity and patience but offer consistent inventory.

### Primary Probate Filter Stack

**Core Probate Indicators**:
- Estate ownership (recorded)
- Trust-owned property
- Recently deceased owner (death records + property records match)
- Attorney-represented ownership (estate attorney as contact)

**Heir Situation Filters**:
- Out-of-state representative
- Multiple heirs (complex decision dynamics)
- Long ownership duration by deceased (deferred maintenance likely)

**Property Condition Indicators**:
- Vacant property status
- Code violations (accumulated)
- Tax delinquency (estate neglect)

### Example Probate Filter Combination

**Market**: Chicago metropolitan area
**Target**: Single-family homes, any condition
**Filters Applied**:
- Owner type: Estate, Trust, or Personal Representative
- Owner address: Different state than property
- Property status: Vacant or unknown occupancy
- Last sale: 20+ years ago

**Results**: 1,834 properties
**Response rate projection**: 5-8%
**Average discount from ARV**: 25-40%

Out-of-state heirs managing Chicago properties face management complexity, seasonal challenges, and emotional distance from the asset. They typically prioritize speed and simplicity over maximum proceeds.

## Rental Portfolio Building: Cash-Flow Filter Combinations

When building rental inventory through wholesaling, your filters must identify properties that meet rental criteria—location, bedroom count, condition, and price points that generate positive cash flow.

### Primary Rental Acquisition Filter Stack

**Location Filters** (neighborhood-specific):
- School district ratings (B+ or better for stable tenants)
- Crime statistics (moderate to low)
- Employment center proximity
- Rental demand indicators (low vacancy rates)

**Property Characteristic Filters**:
- Bedroom count: 3+ (highest rental demand)
- Property age: 1960-2010 (manageable systems)
- Lot size: Standard or larger (tenant preference)
- HOA: None or minimal (cash flow protection)

**Equity/Motivation Filters**:
- Estimated equity: 35%+
- Landlord-owned (non-owner occupied)
- Out-of-state owner
- Ownership duration: 10+ years (tired landlord)

### Example Rental Portfolio Filter Combination

**Market**: Indianapolis, Indiana
**Target**: Cash-flowing rentals, $80,000-$160,000 purchase target
**Filters Applied**:
- Bedrooms: 3+
- Property use: Rental (non-owner occupied)
- Owner location: Out-of-state
- Ownership duration: 8+ years
- Neighborhood: B-class designated areas
- Estimated equity: 40%+

**Results**: 2,156 properties
**Cash-flow analysis**: Properties in this range rent for $1,100-$1,500/month
**Buyer demand**: High (turnkey rental buyers nationwide)

## Fix-and-Flip Acquisitions: Rehab-Ready Filter Combinations

Fix-and-flip buyers require properties with specific value-add potential. Your filters must identify deferred maintenance situations with equity allowing room for renovation budgets and profit margins.

### Primary Fix-and-Flip Filter Stack

**Property Condition Indicators**:
- Code violations (active)
- Vacant property (6+ months indicates neglect)
- Long ownership duration (15+ years—dated finishes)
- Fire damage records (if available)

**Equity Requirements** (flip margin math):
- Minimum 30% equity (light cosmetic)
- Minimum 45% equity (moderate rehab)
- Minimum 55% equity (heavy renovation)

**Motivation Accelerators**:
- Pre-foreclosure status
- Tax delinquency (2+ years)
- Out-of-state ownership
- Inheritance/estate situations

### Example Fix-and-Flip Filter Combination

**Market**: Houston, Texas
**Target**: Properties needing $30,000-$75,000 renovation
**Filters Applied**:
- Estimated equity: 50%+
- Property age: 1965-1990 (dated finishes)
- Active code violations
- Ownership duration: 12+ years
- Property status: Vacant
- ARV range: $180,000-$350,000

**Results**: 967 properties
**Projected acquisition discount**: 30-45% below ARV
**Target buyer profit margin**: $35,000-$65,000 per flip

## Land Deals: Vacant Lot Filter Combinations

Land wholesaling requires different filter approaches. Without structures, you're evaluating location, development potential, and owner motivation based on carrying cost pressure.

### Primary Land Filter Stack

**Property Type Filters**:
- Vacant land (no improvements)
- Zoning: Residential or agricultural (development potential)
- Acreage: Lot size appropriate for market (infill lots vs. rural acreage)
- Utilities: Available at street or adjacent

**Motivation Indicators**:
- Tax delinquent (2+ years—carrying cost pressure)
- Out-of-state owner (no local use or attachment)
- Inheritance (unwanted asset)
- Long ownership duration (unrealized investment)

**Value Indicators**:
- Road frontage (access value)
- Subdivision potential (larger parcels)
- Growing area proximity (appreciation path)

### Example Land Filter Combination

**Market**: Austin, Texas metro fringe areas
**Target**: Residential lots and small acreage (1-10 acres)
**Filters Applied**:
- Property type: Vacant land
- Tax status: Delinquent 1+ years
- Owner location: Out-of-state
- Ownership duration: 5+ years
- Zoning: Residential or agricultural

**Results**: 1,456 parcels
**Typical discount**: 40-60% below market
**Response rate**: 4-7% (land owners respond differently than homeowners)

## Multi-Family Acquisition: Small Apartment Filter Combinations

Multi-family filtering emphasizes owner-operator dynamics—small landlords experiencing management fatigue, capital expense pressure, or life transitions affecting their ability to manage.

### Primary Multi-Family Filter Stack

**Property Type Filters**:
- Units: 2-4 (residential financing available)
- Units: 5-20 (small commercial—owner-operator sweet spot)
- Property age: 1960-1990 (deferred maintenance likely)

**Owner Profile Filters**:
- Individual ownership (not institutional)
- Ownership duration: 10+ years
- Out-of-state owner
- Owner age: 55+ (retirement consideration)

**Distress Indicators**:
- Code violations (multiple units = compounding problems)
- High vacancy (market or management issues)
- Tax delinquency
- Deferred maintenance visible (Google Street View verification)

### Example Multi-Family Filter Combination

**Market**: Kansas City, Missouri
**Target**: 4-12 unit properties
**Filters Applied**:
- Units: 4-12
- Owner type: Individual
- Ownership duration: 12+ years
- Owner age: 60+
- Out-of-state owner

**Results**: 234 properties
**Response rate projection**: 8-12% (higher for multi-family owners)
**Typical motivation**: Capital expense avoidance, management exhaustion, retirement planning

## Adjusting Combinations Based on Exit Strategy

Your exit strategy determines which filters matter most. Work backward from your buyer's requirements.

### Quick Assignment Exit (7-14 day close)
**Filter priority**: Maximum motivation indicators stacked
- Pre-foreclosure + tax delinquent + vacant = urgent seller
- Remove filters that slow response (focus on speed over perfection)

### Double Close Exit (14-30 days)
**Filter priority**: Balance equity depth with motivation
- Higher equity requirements (need room for two transactions)
- Can accept slightly less motivated sellers

### Novation Exit (30-60 days)
**Filter priority**: Property condition and marketability
- Focus on retail-ready or light cosmetic properties
- Conventional buyer-friendly characteristics

### Creative Finance Exit (30-90 days)
**Filter priority**: Financing terms over equity
- Low equity acceptable if terms favorable
- Owner flexibility indicators more important

## Matching Filter Combinations to Your Buyer List

Your buyer list is your most valuable filter guide. Study what your buyers actually purchase—not what they say they want.

### Buyer Profile Analysis Process

1. **Export last 20 purchases** by your top 5 buyers
2. **Identify common characteristics**: Price range, bedroom count, location clusters, property age
3. **Reverse-engineer filters** that would have identified these properties before purchase
4. **Test filter combinations** against known buyer preferences

### Example: Buyer-Driven Filter Creation

**Buyer Profile**: Regional fix-and-flip company purchasing 15 properties monthly
**Purchase History Analysis**:
- Average ARV: $225,000-$285,000
- Average purchase: 65% of ARV
- Renovation budget: $35,000-$55,000
- Locations: 6 specific zip codes
- Property age: 1975-1995

**Resulting Filter Combination**:
- Zip codes: [specific 6 codes]
- ARV range: $200,000-$310,000
- Estimated equity: 45%+
- Year built: 1970-2000
- Motivation stacking: Code violations OR tax delinquent OR vacant

This buyer-matched filter produces properties your buyer actually wants—shortening your assignment timeline and reducing marketing waste.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Over-filtering initial lists**: Starting with too many filters produces lists too small for statistical marketing success. Begin with 3-4 filters and add incrementally.

2. **Ignoring equity requirements by strategy**: Subject-to deals need low equity; wholesale deals need high equity. Using wholesale equity filters for subject-to campaigns wastes marketing budget.

3. **Copying competitor filter combinations**: Your buyer list differs from competitors. Filter combinations must match YOUR buyers, not industry generics.

4. **Neglecting filter combination testing**: Running identical campaigns without A/B testing filter variations prevents optimization. Test single filter changes to identify impact.

5. **Using property-only filters without motivation**: High equity alone doesn't create motivation. Always combine equity filters with distress or life-situation indicators.

6. **Applying residential filters to land**: Land deals require different motivation indicators. Tax delinquency matters more; condition indicators don't exist.

7. **Forgetting neighborhood-level filters**: Same filters in different neighborhoods produce dramatically different response rates and deal quality.

8. **Static filter combinations**: Markets change. Recession periods require different filter emphasis than appreciating markets. Review and adjust quarterly.

9. **Skipping buyer list alignment**: Marketing to leads your buyers won't purchase wastes acquisition costs and damages seller relationships.

10. **Underestimating filter combination mathematics**: Adding one filter can reduce list size by 50-80%. Calculate resulting list size before pulling data.
