# Contract Assignment Risks - Complete Risk Assessment and Mitigation Guide for Wholesalers

## Quick Reference

- Assignment is restricted or requires special licensing in Illinois, Oklahoma, Ohio, Arizona, South Carolina, and Philadelphia; always verify current regulations in your market
- Include explicit assignment language in your purchase contract—never rely solely on "and/or assigns" after your name
- Many title companies refuse to process assignments; establish relationships with assignment-friendly title companies before putting properties under contract
- When your assignment fee exceeds 15-20% of the purchase price, consider a double close to maintain transaction privacy and reduce legal exposure
- Always use a separate Assignment of Contract Agreement—never assign on a handshake or verbal agreement
- Protect earnest money by making it refundable until your due diligence period expires and using assignment-specific contingencies
- Sellers must be informed about assignability at contract signing; hiding this creates legal liability
- If an assignment falls through, you remain liable under the original purchase contract unless you have proper exit contingencies
- Assignment fee disclosure requirements vary by state—some require disclosure to all parties, others only to the party paying
- Build relationships with real estate attorneys who understand wholesaling; a single legal challenge can cost more than years of attorney retainer fees

## Understanding Contract Assignment Fundamentals

Contract assignment in real estate wholesaling means transferring your rights and obligations under a purchase agreement to another buyer. When you assign a contract, you're not selling property—you're selling your contractual position. This distinction matters enormously for legal compliance and risk management.

The assignor (you, the wholesaler) transfers rights to the assignee (your end buyer). Your assignment fee represents the difference between what you agreed to pay the seller and what your buyer pays you for those contractual rights. While conceptually simple, assignment carries substantial risks that can destroy deals, damage relationships, and create legal liability.

## States Where Assignment Is Restricted or Prohibited

Contract assignment faces regulatory scrutiny in several jurisdictions. Understanding these restrictions prevents costly legal violations.

### High-Restriction States

**Illinois** requires anyone engaging in real estate transactions for profit to hold a real estate license. The Illinois Real Estate License Act has been interpreted to include wholesale activities, making unlicensed assignment potentially illegal. Wholesalers in Illinois typically must either obtain a license, work under a licensed broker, or structure transactions as double closes.

**Oklahoma** enacted legislation in 2023 requiring disclosure when contracts are assigned and limiting certain marketing activities for non-licensed individuals.

**Ohio** interprets its licensing laws strictly. Marketing a property you don't own can constitute unlicensed brokerage activity. Many Ohio wholesalers use double closes exclusively.

**Arizona** requires specific disclosures when assigning contracts and limits marketing activities for unlicensed individuals.

**South Carolina** has an aggressive real estate commission that scrutinizes wholesaling activities for unlicensed practice.

### Municipal Restrictions

**Philadelphia, Pennsylvania** requires a real estate license for anyone who engages in wholesaling activities, including marketing properties for assignment.

**Some Texas municipalities** have explored restrictions, though statewide wholesaling remains legal with proper contract language.

### Best Practices for Restricted Jurisdictions

1. Consult with a local real estate attorney before your first deal
2. Consider obtaining a real estate license for maximum flexibility
3. Structure deals as double closes rather than assignments
4. Never market the property itself—only market your contract rights
5. Maintain documentation proving you had equitable interest before marketing

## Assignment Clause Language That Protects You

The assignment clause in your purchase agreement determines whether you can legally assign and what protections you retain. Weak language creates vulnerability; strong language provides flexibility and protection.

### Essential Assignment Clause Components

**Basic Protective Language:**
```
This Agreement and all rights hereunder may be freely assigned by Buyer 
to any individual, trust, corporation, limited liability company, or 
other entity without the consent of Seller. Upon assignment, Assignee 
shall assume all Buyer obligations hereunder, and the original Buyer 
shall be released from further liability, except as otherwise agreed 
in writing.
```

**Enhanced Protection Version:**
```
Buyer's Right to Assign: Buyer, at Buyer's sole discretion, may assign 
this Agreement in whole or in part to any party without prior notice to 
or consent from Seller. Assignment may occur at any time prior to closing. 
Upon execution of a valid assignment, the assignee shall be substituted 
as Buyer for all purposes under this Agreement. The original Buyer shall 
be released from all obligations except for earnest money already deposited, 
which shall be handled per the terms of the Assignment Agreement between 
Buyer and Assignee.
```

### Critical Elements to Include

- Explicit right to assign without seller consent
- Assignment may occur to "any party" (allows flexibility in buyer selection)
- Release of original buyer liability upon valid assignment
- Clear handling of earnest money upon assignment
- No restrictions on assignment timing

## "And/Or Assigns" vs. Explicit Assignment Clause

Many new wholesalers believe adding "and/or assigns" after their name on the buyer line is sufficient. This approach creates significant risk.

### Problems With "And/Or Assigns" Alone

The phrase "and/or assigns" merely indicates you might assign—it doesn't guarantee the right to do so. If the contract contains any conflicting language, standard form anti-assignment provisions, or if a dispute arises, courts may not enforce your assumed right to assign.

Standard real estate contracts often contain anti-assignment clauses buried in boilerplate language. If you haven't explicitly added assignment rights, these clauses may override your "and/or assigns" designation.

### When "And/Or Assigns" Works

This approach is generally acceptable when:
- Using your own custom contract with full assignment language elsewhere
- The contract explicitly permits assignment in another section
- You're dealing with sophisticated sellers who understand the transaction
- State law clearly permits assignment by default

### When to Use Explicit Assignment Clause

Always include an explicit assignment clause when:
- Using standard association forms (NAR, state-specific)
- Working with sellers unfamiliar with assignment
- Dealing with higher-value properties ($200,000+)
- Operating in states with stricter regulations
- You want maximum legal protection

**Best practice:** Use both "and/or assigns" after your name AND include an explicit assignment clause in the terms section.

## Assignment Fee Disclosure Requirements

Assignment fee disclosure requirements vary significantly by state and situation. Failure to comply creates legal liability and can void transactions.

### States Requiring Full Disclosure

Some states require disclosure of assignment fees to all parties:
- **Texas** requires disclosure to the title company and may require disclosure to the seller depending on the transaction structure
- **Florida** generally requires transparency in real estate transactions
- **California** has extensive disclosure requirements for real estate transactions

### General Disclosure Guidelines

**To Sellers:** While not always legally required, disclosing that you intend to assign and may profit from the transaction protects you from fraud claims. You don't necessarily need to disclose the exact amount.

**Recommended seller disclosure language:**
```
"I'm purchasing your property with the intention of assigning my 
contract rights to another buyer at closing. I will receive 
compensation for this assignment."
```

**To Title Companies:** Almost always disclose your assignment fee. Title companies handle the settlement statement and need accurate information.

**To End Buyers:** Your assignment agreement should clearly state the assignment fee they're paying.

## Seller Objections to Assignment

Sellers frequently object to assignment once they understand the implications. Handling these objections professionally protects your deal and relationship.

### Common Seller Objections and Responses

**"I don't want strangers buying my house"**
Response: "I understand completely. The buyer I assign to will be fully vetted and financially qualified. They'll need to meet all the same closing requirements as any traditional buyer. You're protected because the contract terms don't change—only who shows up at closing."

**"If you're making money, you should pay me more"**
Response: "The price we agreed to works for your situation—you mentioned needing [their stated motivation]. My profit comes from my expertise in finding buyers quickly and handling the transaction complexity. You get certainty and speed; I get compensated for providing that."

**"I want to meet the actual buyer first"**
Response: "That's reasonable. Let me get the assignment finalized, and then I'll arrange an introduction before closing. The contract terms remain exactly the same regardless of who closes."

**"Why can't you just buy it yourself?"**
Response: "I'm an investor who specializes in connecting motivated sellers with qualified buyers. My value is in making transactions happen quickly and smoothly. If I purchased every property myself, I couldn't help as many sellers."

### When Sellers Absolutely Refuse

If a seller refuses assignment after signing an assignable contract:
1. Review your contract language—you may have the right to assign regardless
2. Offer a double close as an alternative
3. Negotiate an early release if the deal isn't worth fighting for
4. Consult an attorney if the seller threatens to breach

## Buyer's Right to Inspect Before Assignment

Your end buyers need to evaluate the property before committing to the assignment. Managing this process protects everyone involved.

### Inspection Timing Considerations

You should facilitate buyer inspections during your own due diligence period whenever possible. This:
- Allows buyers to identify issues before they're committed
- Gives you time to find alternate buyers if the first backs out
- Reduces risk of assignment falling through after contingencies expire

### Protecting Yourself During Buyer Inspections

- Require proof of funds before scheduling inspections
- Have buyers sign a property access agreement
- Maintain communication with sellers about inspection schedules
- Never promise access you can't guarantee

### Assignment Agreement Inspection Language

Include this protection in your assignment agreement:
```
Assignee acknowledges having the opportunity to inspect the Property 
prior to executing this Assignment. Assignee accepts the Property in 
its current condition and releases Assignor from any claims related 
to Property condition.
```

## Title Company Cooperation With Assignments

Not all title companies handle assignments. Working with the wrong title company can derail your closing at the worst possible moment.

### Identifying Assignment-Friendly Title Companies

Before putting properties under contract:
1. Call title companies and ask: "Do you handle wholesale real estate assignments?"
2. Ask specifically about their assignment fee—some charge extra
3. Request their assignment paperwork to review
4. Ask how they handle HUD-1/settlement statement preparation for assignments
5. Get references from other local wholesalers

### Common Title Company Concerns

**Fee disclosure:** Title companies must accurately report all funds on settlement statements. Some are uncomfortable when assignment fees are large relative to purchase prices.

**Wire fraud concerns:** Multiple parties and last-minute changes raise red flags.

**Lender restrictions:** If your end buyer uses financing, some lenders prohibit assignments or have seasoning requirements.

### Building Title Company Relationships

- Use the same assignment-friendly title company consistently
- Provide complete documentation upfront
- Communicate clearly about transaction structure
- Pay your fees promptly
- Refer other investors to build goodwill

## When Double-Close Is Safer Than Assignment

Sometimes assignment isn't the best strategy. Recognizing these situations protects your business.

### Use Double-Close When:

**Assignment fee is large relative to purchase price**
If your assignment fee exceeds 15-20% of the A-B purchase price, sellers and their attorneys may challenge the transaction. A $30,000 assignment fee on a $100,000 purchase looks different than on a $500,000 purchase.

**Seller is likely to object**
If you sense the seller will react negatively to learning about your assignment fee, a double close maintains privacy.

**Operating in restricted states**
In Illinois, Ohio, and other restrictive jurisdictions, double closing reduces licensing scrutiny.

**Dealing with REO, bank-owned, or institutional sellers**
Corporate sellers typically prohibit assignment in their contracts and won't negotiate.

**Complex title situations**
When title issues require extensive work, maintaining direct control through a double close provides flexibility.

**End buyer is using financing**
Some lenders won't fund assigned contracts or have title seasoning requirements that assignment doesn't satisfy.

## Assignment Agreement Essentials

Your Assignment of Contract Agreement is a legally binding document. Missing elements create vulnerability.

### Required Components

1. **Identification of original contract:** Date, parties, property address, and purchase price of the underlying purchase agreement

2. **Assignment fee and payment terms:** Exact amount, when due, and payment method

3. **Earnest money handling:** Who receives the original earnest money; what additional deposit the assignee provides

4. **Closing deadline:** Must align with or precede the original contract closing date

5. **Assignee obligations:** Explicit assumption of all buyer obligations under the original contract

6. **Default provisions:** What happens if assignee fails to close; your remedies

7. **Property condition acknowledgment:** Assignee accepts property "as-is"

8. **Non-refundable deposit clause:** Protects your assignment fee deposit

9. **Cooperation clause:** Assignee agrees to cooperate with closing requirements

### Sample Assignment Fee Structure

```
Assignment Fee:                               $15,000
Non-Refundable Deposit Due at Signing:        $5,000
Balance Due at Closing:                       $10,000
```

## Protecting Your Earnest Money in Assignments

Earnest money represents real financial risk. Protect it through proper contract structuring and assignment documentation.

### Contract-Level Protection

Include these provisions in your original purchase agreement:
- Extended inspection period (14-21 days minimum)
- Financing contingency (even if you won't use financing)
- Clear earnest money refund provisions
- Identify specific circumstances triggering refund

### Assignment-Level Protection

In your Assignment Agreement:
- Require non-refundable assignment deposit from buyer
- Ensure buyer's deposit covers your earnest money exposure
- Specify that your original earnest money returns to you if deal fails due to buyer default
- Include language making buyer's deposit applicable to damages if they default

### Escrow Considerations

- Deposit earnest money with title companies you trust
- Understand escrow dispute resolution procedures
- Never deposit more earnest money than you can afford to lose
- Consider performance bonds for large earnest money requirements

## What Happens If Assignment Falls Through

When assignments fail, you face immediate obligations under the original contract. Preparation prevents catastrophe.

### Your Obligations When Buyer Defaults

If your assigned buyer fails to close, you remain responsible for:
- Closing the original transaction yourself
- Finding a replacement buyer before closing deadline
- Paying any extension fees to the seller
- Potentially forfeiting earnest money if you can't perform

### Protective Measures

**Build backup buyer lists:** Always have 2-3 interested buyers for every deal

**Negotiate closing extensions in advance:** Include extension rights in your original contract

**Maintain cash reserves:** Have funds available for emergency closes

**Include buyer default provisions:** Your assignment agreement should address buyer default consequences

**Require substantial non-refundable deposits:** $5,000+ deposits create buyer commitment

### Recovery When Assignments Fail

If your buyer defaults:
1. Immediately contact backup buyers
2. Negotiate timeline extensions with the seller
3. Pursue the defaulting buyer for damages per your assignment agreement
4. Consider closing the transaction yourself if profitable
5. As a last resort, negotiate release from the original contract

## Legal Challenges to Wholesaling Via Assignment

Understanding potential legal challenges helps you structure transactions defensively.

### Common Legal Theories Used Against Wholesalers

**Unlicensed brokerage activity**
Regulators argue that marketing property for a fee constitutes brokerage requiring a license. Defense: You're marketing your contract rights, not the property itself, and you have equitable interest.

**Fraud or misrepresentation**
Sellers claim they didn't understand assignment or were misled about your intentions. Defense: Clear disclosure at contract signing, documented conversations.

**Interference with contract**
End buyers claim you interfered with their ability to purchase directly from the seller. Defense: You had a valid contract first; no interference occurred.

**Failure to disclose material facts**
Claims that you knew property defects and didn't disclose. Defense: Assignment agreements confirming buyer conducted independent inspection.

### Protective Practices

1. Always have a signed, assignable purchase agreement before marketing
2. Document seller understanding of assignment rights
3. Use attorney-reviewed contracts and assignment agreements
4. Maintain records of all communications
5. Carry errors and omissions insurance when available
6. Operate under an LLC or corporation for liability protection

## Examples

### Example 1: Standard Assignment Success

**Situation:** You contract a distressed property at 123 Oak Street for $85,000. After marketing to your buyer list, you assign to a rehabber for $95,000.

**Numbers:**
- Original purchase price: $85,000
- Assignment fee: $10,000
- Your earnest money: $1,000 (refundable during 14-day inspection)
- Buyer's non-refundable deposit: $5,000

**Process:**
1. Sign purchase agreement with seller including explicit assignment clause
2. Deposit $1,000 earnest money with title company
3. Market contract rights to buyer list
4. Execute assignment agreement; collect $5,000 non-refundable deposit
5. Title company prepares closing documents showing all three parties
6. At closing, buyer pays $95,000; seller receives $85,000; you receive $10,000

### Example 2: Assignment Requiring Double Close

**Situation:** You contract a property for $120,000 with a potential assignment fee of $35,000 (29% of purchase price). Your attorney recommends double closing.

**Numbers:**
- A-B purchase price: $120,000
- B-C sale price: $155,000
- Your profit: $35,000 (minus closing costs of approximately $2,500)
- Net profit: $32,500

**Why double close was better:**
- Assignment fee exceeded 20% threshold
- Seller was represented by an attorney who might have challenged
- Maintained transaction privacy
- Eliminated fraud risk

### Example 3: Assignment Fall-Through Recovery

**Situation:** Your buyer defaults three days before closing on a $95,000 assignment.

**Response:**
1. Contact two backup buyers immediately
2. Backup buyer #2 agrees to $92,000 assignment (you accept $3,000 less)
3. Request one-week extension from seller (granted with $500 fee)
4. Execute new assignment agreement
5. Close successfully
6. Pursue original defaulting buyer for $5,000 non-refundable deposit
7. Retain deposit as partial compensation for reduced profit and extension fee

**Lesson:** Backup buyers and extension provisions saved the deal.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Relying solely on "and/or assigns"** — Always include explicit assignment language in the contract body
2. **Not verifying title company handles assignments** — Confirm assignment capability before opening escrow
3. **Failing to disclose assignment intentions to sellers** — Creates fraud liability and relationship damage
4. **Assigning without a written assignment agreement** — Verbal assignments are unenforceable and dangerous
5. **Not collecting non-refundable deposits from buyers** — Buyers without skin in the game walk away easily
6. **Operating in restricted states without legal guidance** — A single enforcement action can end your business
7. **Assigning large fees without considering double close** — Triggers seller disputes and legal scrutiny
8. **Not having backup buyers** — One buyer backing out shouldn't destroy your deal
9. **Letting buyers inspect without proof of funds** — Wastes time and creates seller relationship issues
10. **Ignoring your continuing liability under the original contract** — Assignment doesn't automatically release you
