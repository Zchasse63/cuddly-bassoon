## The Estate Situation

Harold Mitchell passed away on January 15, 2025, at age 78. He had lived in his home at 847 Maple Street for 43 years but had no living trust. His estate entered formal probate through Los Angeles County Superior Court on February 3, 2025.

Harold left three adult children as heirs:
- **Sarah Mitchell-Chen** (age 52, local resident) - Named executor
- **David Mitchell** (age 49, lives in Texas)
- **Jennifer Mitchell-Ross** (age 45, lives in Florida)

The property represented approximately 70% of the total estate value, with the remainder in bank accounts and personal property. Harold had no surviving spouse, and the home was owned free and clear with no mortgage.

## Finding the Probate Lead

The wholesaler, Marcus Thompson, found this lead through systematic probate lead generation:

**Lead Source Strategy:**
Marcus pulls probate filings from Los Angeles County Superior Court every two weeks, focusing on cases filed 4-8 weeks prior. This timing is strategic—long enough for the executor to receive Letters Testamentary (official authority to act), but early enough to reach them before competing investors.

**Initial Research:**
- Cross-referenced executor name with property records
- Confirmed property ownership through county assessor data
- Verified no liens or encumbrances through preliminary title search
- Used property tax records to estimate value range
- Drove by property to assess condition (noted overgrown yard, dated exterior)

**First Contact:**
Marcus sent a handwritten condolence letter on March 18, 2025—exactly 6 weeks after the probate filing. The letter expressed sympathy, briefly introduced himself as a local investor who helps families with inherited properties, and included his phone number without any pressure.

Sarah called on March 24, 2025, explaining she was overwhelmed managing the estate while working full-time and coordinating with out-of-state siblings.

## Working with Multiple Heirs

The biggest challenge in this deal was managing three heirs with different priorities and communication styles.

**The Heir Dynamics:**

*Sarah (Executor):* Wanted to sell quickly and fairly. She lived 45 minutes from the property and was tired of driving over to check on it. She had authority to sign contracts but needed sibling agreement for major decisions.

*David:* Initially wanted to keep the property as a rental. He saw it as passive income and an emotional connection to their father. He wasn't aware of the property's true condition or management requirements.

*Jennifer:* Desperately needed her inheritance share. She was going through a divorce and had immediate financial pressures. She pushed for the fastest possible sale regardless of price.

**Resolution Strategy:**

Marcus scheduled a video call with all three heirs present—critical for transparency and preventing sibling conflicts later. During the call, he:

1. Walked them through the property's current condition via photos and video
2. Showed comparable sales data for renovated vs. as-is properties
3. Explained the realistic timeline for each selling option (traditional listing vs. investor sale)
4. Provided a written breakdown of estimated net proceeds for each scenario

David's "keep as rental" idea evaporated when Marcus showed deferred maintenance costs, property management fees, and the reality of remote landlording. Jennifer's timeline concerns were addressed by demonstrating the 30-45 day close possible with an investor sale versus 90-120+ days for traditional listing.

## Legal Requirements and Attorney Involvement

**Estate Attorney Role:**
Sarah had retained attorney Patricia Nguyen to handle the probate administration. Marcus proactively offered to speak with Patricia to ensure any purchase agreement met legal requirements. This transparency built immediate credibility.

Key legal considerations addressed:
- Confirmation that Letters Testamentary were issued and valid
- Verification that IAEA (Independent Administration of Estates Act) authority was granted, allowing sale without court confirmation
- Review of the purchase agreement by the estate attorney
- Proper titling of the contract (Sarah Mitchell-Chen, as Executor of the Estate of Harold Mitchell, Deceased)

**Assignment Disclosure:**
Marcus fully disclosed his intent to assign the contract. He explained:
- The assignment fee would come from his buyer, not reduce their proceeds
- He would find a qualified cash buyer who could close quickly
- If he couldn't find a buyer, he would either close himself or release the contract (he included a contingency clause)

The estate attorney appreciated this transparency and had seen too many wholesalers try to hide their position.

## Timeline and Court Process

Because California IAEA authority was granted, no court confirmation hearing was required. Here's the actual deal timeline:

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Feb 3 | Probate filed |
| Feb 28 | Letters Testamentary issued |
| Mar 18 | Marcus sends condolence letter |
| Mar 24 | Sarah calls Marcus |
| Apr 2 | Property walkthrough with Marcus |
| Apr 7 | Video call with all three heirs |
| Apr 12 | Purchase agreement signed ($287,000) |
| Apr 14 | Contract sent to buyers list |
| Apr 18 | Assignment agreement signed with end buyer ($305,500) |
| May 8 | Clear title received |
| May 22 | Closing completed |

**Total Timeline:** 94 days from first contact to close

## Property Condition and Vacancy Issues

The property had been vacant since Harold's hospitalization in December 2024. Marcus identified these issues during his inspection:

**Major Repairs Needed:**
- Roof: Active leak in master bedroom, full replacement needed ($18,000)
- HVAC: Original 1978 system, non-functional ($8,500)
- Plumbing: Galvanized pipes with corrosion, recommended full repipe ($12,000)
- Electrical: Federal Pacific panel requiring replacement ($4,500)
- Kitchen: Completely dated, functional but unmarketable ($12,000)
- Cosmetic updates throughout ($7,000)

**Total Estimated Repairs:** $62,000

**Vacancy Concerns:**
- Water had been shut off (winterization incomplete)
- Overgrown landscaping creating neighbor complaints
- Mail piling up, advertising vacancy
- One broken window from attempted break-in

Marcus helped Sarah address the security concerns by recommending a $50/month vacancy monitoring service and arranging for a locksmith to secure the property. This goodwill gesture cost Marcus nothing but built significant trust.

## Pricing Strategy for Estate Sales

Marcus used the following formula to structure his offer:

**The Calculation:**
- ARV: $485,000 (based on three comparable renovated sales within 0.5 miles)
- Repair Costs: $62,000
- Holding Costs (3 months): $8,000
- Buying/Selling Costs: $35,000 (estimated for end buyer's full retail exit)
- End Buyer Profit Margin: $75,000 (15.5%)
- Target Assignment Fee: $18,500

**Working Backward:**
$485,000 - $62,000 - $8,000 - $35,000 - $75,000 - $18,500 = $286,500

**Final Offer:** $287,000 (rounded up slightly for negotiation goodwill)

Marcus presented this offer alongside two alternatives:
1. Traditional listing: Estimated 90-120 days, $415,000-430,000 sale price after repairs credits, ~$385,000 net after commissions
2. As-is MLS listing: Estimated 60-90 days, $320,000-340,000 sale price, ~$305,000 net after commissions
3. His cash offer: 30-45 days, $287,000, no commissions, no repairs, no showings

The heirs chose certainty and speed over maximized price.

## Distribution of Proceeds Among Heirs

The estate attorney handled distribution according to Harold's will (equal thirds). From the $287,000 sale:

- Title/escrow fees: $2,100
- Prorated property taxes: $1,850
- Estate attorney fees (remaining balance): $4,200
- Outstanding utility bills: $340
- **Net to estate:** $278,510
- **Per heir distribution:** $92,836.67 each

## Deal Structure and Assignment Numbers

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Contract Price | $287,000 |
| Assignment Fee | $18,500 |
| End Buyer Purchase Price | $305,500 |
| End Buyer's Estimated ARV | $485,000 |
| End Buyer's Estimated Profit | $56,500 |

The end buyer, a local fix-and-flip investor, was satisfied with the deal metrics (18.5% ROI on a 4-month project).

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Timing matters**: Reaching executors 4-8 weeks after filing catches them when they're organized enough to act but before competition arrives.

2. **Include all decision-makers early**: The video call with all three heirs prevented later disagreements and second-guessing.

3. **Transparency builds trust**: Full disclosure of the assignment intent and fee structure prevented legal issues and built credibility.

4. **Help with small problems**: Assisting with property security concerns cost nothing but created reciprocal goodwill.

5. **Know the probate type**: Understanding IAEA authority versus court confirmation dramatically affects timeline estimates.

6. **Price with comparisons**: Presenting multiple selling options (traditional, as-is MLS, investor) helped heirs make informed decisions without pressure.

## Probate-Specific Strategies That Made This Deal Work

- **Patience over pressure**: Probate sellers are grieving. Marcus waited for Sarah to call him rather than following up aggressively.
- **Professional network**: Having relationships with estate attorneys who could vouch for his professionalism accelerated trust-building.
- **Executor-focused communication**: All formal communication went through Sarah as executor, with siblings CC'd for transparency.
- **Flexible closing timeline**: The contract included a closing date range (30-45 days) to accommodate any estate administration delays.
- **Clear escape clauses**: The contract included a 14-day inspection contingency, protecting Marcus while also giving the estate a defined commitment period.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Contacting heirs before Letters Testamentary are issued** - The executor has no legal authority yet, wasting everyone's time
2. **Ignoring non-executor heirs** - They can derail deals later if they feel excluded from decisions
3. **Underestimating repair costs on long-vacant properties** - Deferred maintenance compounds rapidly
4. **Not verifying IAEA authority** - Court confirmation adds 45-60 days to timelines
5. **Rushing grieving families** - Probate leads require patience; aggressive tactics backfire
6. **Failing to disclose assignment intent** - Estate attorneys will catch this, destroying credibility
7. **Skipping the estate attorney relationship** - They're gatekeepers who can recommend or warn against you
8. **Assuming one heir speaks for all** - Always verify decision-making authority and get all signatures when required
9. **Ignoring vacant property liability** - Properties with break-ins or injuries create estate liability and seller motivation
10. **Using standard contracts without probate language** - Proper titling and executor capacity statements are legally required
