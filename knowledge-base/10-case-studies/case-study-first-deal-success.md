# Case Study: Marcus's First Wholesale Deal - From Nervous Beginner to $8,500 Assignment Fee

## Quick Reference

- **Wholesaler Profile**: Marcus, 28, working full-time with $2,000 starting budget and zero real estate experience
- **Lead Source**: Handwritten yellow letters mailed to a probate list of 200 addresses
- **Property**: 3-bedroom, 1-bath ranch needing $35,000 in repairs in Indianapolis, Indiana
- **Purchase Price Negotiated**: $67,000 (seller initially wanted $95,000)
- **Assignment Fee Earned**: $8,500
- **Timeline**: 47 days from first marketing piece to closing
- **Critical Success Factor**: Following up consistently despite initial rejection
- **Biggest Mistake Made**: Almost walking away after seller said "no" the first time
- **Key Lesson**: The fortune is in the follow-up—motivated sellers often need time to process

## Background: Who Was Marcus Before His First Deal?

Marcus worked as an accounts receivable specialist at a manufacturing company, earning $52,000 annually. He had no real estate experience, no connections in the industry, and had never even attended a real estate closing before. His total starting capital was $2,000—money he had saved specifically to try wholesaling after watching YouTube videos for three months.

His resources were limited:
- **Budget**: $2,000 for marketing and education
- **Time**: 10-15 hours per week (evenings and weekends)
- **Knowledge**: Online courses and free YouTube content
- **Network**: Zero real estate contacts
- **Experience**: None—had never spoken to a distressed seller

Marcus represents the typical beginner: motivated, under-resourced, and unsure if wholesaling actually works for "regular people."

## How Marcus Generated His First Lead

After researching marketing methods, Marcus chose direct mail targeting probate leads. He purchased a list of 200 recently filed probate cases in Marion County, Indiana, for $150 from a data provider. He then spent $340 on yellow letter supplies and postage, handwriting each letter himself over two weekends.

His letter was simple:

> "Hi, my name is Marcus. I noticed you may have recently inherited a property on Maple Street. If you're considering selling and want a quick, hassle-free cash offer, I'd love to help. I buy houses in any condition. Call or text me at [phone number]. —Marcus"

Of the 200 letters sent, he received 11 phone calls over three weeks—a 5.5% response rate. Seven callers weren't interested or had already sold. Three were just curious. One caller, Mrs. Dorothy Williams, had real motivation.

## The Fears and Uncertainties Marcus Faced

When Dorothy called, Marcus nearly let it go to voicemail. His hands were shaking as he answered. His fears were overwhelming:

- **Fear of sounding incompetent**: "What if she asks questions I can't answer?"
- **Fear of making legal mistakes**: "What if I accidentally say something that creates liability?"
- **Fear of embarrassment**: "What if she realizes I've never done this before?"
- **Fear of the unknown**: "I don't even know what happens at a closing"
- **Imposter syndrome**: "Who am I to be buying houses?"

Marcus later admitted he almost didn't mail those letters because he was terrified of actually getting a response. This is the paradox every new wholesaler faces—you want leads, but you're scared of what happens when you get them.

## The Property and Seller Situation

Dorothy Williams was 67 years old and had inherited her late brother's home six months earlier. The property details:

- **Address**: 3847 Maple Street, Indianapolis, IN
- **Property Type**: 3-bed, 1-bath single-family ranch built in 1962
- **Square Footage**: 1,180 square feet
- **Lot Size**: 0.18 acres
- **Condition**: Needed roof replacement, HVAC update, kitchen renovation, and cosmetic updates throughout
- **Estimated Repair Costs**: $30,000-$40,000
- **After Repair Value (ARV)**: $145,000 based on comparable sales

Dorothy's situation created motivation:
- She lived 90 minutes away and couldn't maintain the property
- The house had been vacant for 8 months, accumulating utility costs and liability
- She was paying $180/month in property taxes and insurance with no rental income
- Her brother had been a hoarder, and the cleanout felt emotionally overwhelming
- She wanted closure and didn't want to deal with repairs, showings, or real estate agents

## The Negotiation Process: A Beginner's Journey

### First Conversation
Dorothy initially wanted $95,000 for the property—a number based on emotional attachment, not market reality. Marcus, following a script he had practiced, asked questions instead of immediately countering:

- "What would you do with the money from the sale?"
- "How long have you been thinking about selling?"
- "What's been stopping you from listing it traditionally?"

He learned Dorothy wanted to pay off some medical debt and take her grandchildren on a vacation. She was exhausted by the whole situation.

### The Initial Rejection
Marcus offered $65,000, explaining the repair costs and his need to make a profit. Dorothy declined, saying she needed to think about it and would probably just list with a realtor.

**This is where most beginners quit.** Marcus almost did too.

### The Follow-Up That Changed Everything
Two weeks later, Marcus sent a simple text: "Hi Dorothy, it's Marcus. Just checking in—no pressure at all. I hope you're doing well, and my offer still stands if anything changes."

Dorothy called him the next day. The realtor she contacted wanted to list at $89,000, but after explaining that she'd need to clean out the house, make repairs, and wait 60-90 days for a sale (possibly longer), Dorothy realized a quick cash sale had real value.

### Final Negotiation
They settled on $67,000. Marcus had increased his offer by $2,000, and Dorothy had reduced her expectation by $28,000. The agreement was:
- **Purchase price**: $67,000
- **Closing timeline**: 21 days
- **Earnest money deposit**: $500 (Marcus was terrified to risk even this amount)
- **Contingency**: 14-day inspection period for Marcus to find a buyer

## Finding His First Cash Buyer

This was Marcus's most stressful phase. He had no buyers list and only 14 days to find someone.

His buyer-finding strategy:
1. **Posted on Facebook groups**: Local real estate investor groups yielded 4 interested parties
2. **Called "We Buy Houses" signs**: Found 3 potential buyers this way
3. **Attended one local REIA meeting**: Connected with 2 active flippers
4. **Posted on Craigslist**: Received 6 inquiries (mostly unqualified)

Within 8 days, Marcus had shown the property to 5 serious buyers. He received three offers:
- Buyer A: $72,000 (wanted 30-day close)
- Buyer B: $75,500 (could close in 14 days, proof of funds verified)
- Buyer C: $74,000 (wanted seller financing—not applicable)

Marcus assigned the contract to Buyer B for $75,500, creating an **$8,500 assignment fee**.

## Timeline: 47 Days from Start to Close

| Day | Milestone |
|-----|-----------|
| Day 1 | Purchased probate list |
| Days 2-14 | Handwrote and mailed 200 yellow letters |
| Day 18 | Received call from Dorothy |
| Day 19 | Visited property, made initial offer of $65,000 |
| Day 19 | Offer rejected |
| Day 33 | Sent follow-up text message |
| Day 34 | Dorothy called back |
| Day 35 | Negotiated final price of $67,000, signed purchase agreement |
| Day 36-43 | Marketed property to buyers |
| Day 43 | Signed assignment contract with Buyer B for $75,500 |
| Day 47 | Closed at title company, received $8,500 wire transfer |

## Mistakes Marcus Made Along the Way

1. **Waited too long to mail**: Spent 3 weeks "perfecting" his letter when good enough would have worked
2. **Almost didn't follow up**: Nearly accepted Dorothy's first "no" as final
3. **Underestimated repair costs initially**: His first ARV analysis was off by $15,000 before a buyer helped him refine it
4. **Didn't have a buyers list ready**: Should have been building this while marketing to sellers
5. **Negotiated against himself**: Initially offered $65,000 but could have started at $58,000
6. **Forgot to verify proof of funds**: Almost assigned to a buyer who couldn't actually close
7. **Didn't record the contract**: Left the deal vulnerable until closing

## Confidence Gained and Transformation

After closing, Marcus experienced a fundamental shift in belief. He now knew:
- Motivated sellers really do exist and will take below-market offers
- The paperwork isn't as complicated as he feared
- Title companies handle most of the complex closing work
- Follow-up separates successful wholesalers from failures
- $8,500 for 47 days of part-time work beat months of his W-2 income

Marcus completed 4 more deals in his first year, earning $41,000 in assignment fees while keeping his full-time job.

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Action beats perfection**: Sending 200 imperfect letters beats sending zero perfect ones
2. **Follow-up is everything**: His only deal came from a seller who initially said no
3. **Sellers have problems, not just properties**: Understanding Dorothy's emotional exhaustion was more important than analyzing square footage
4. **Build your buyers list simultaneously**: Don't wait until you have a deal
5. **Trust the process**: The first deal proves the model works

## Advice for Other Beginners

Marcus now mentors new wholesalers and shares this advice:

> "Your first deal will feel harder than every deal after it combined. You're not just learning wholesaling—you're overcoming years of limiting beliefs about what's possible for you. Send the mail. Make the calls. Follow up when they say no. The skills you build on your first deal become the foundation for a career."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid on Your First Deal

1. **Waiting until you "know enough"**—you learn by doing, not studying
2. **Giving up after initial rejection**—motivated sellers often need time
3. **Skipping the follow-up**—most deals close on the 3rd-7th contact
4. **Not verifying buyer funds**—always confirm proof of funds before assigning
5. **Overcomplicating your marketing**—simple, consistent outreach works
6. **Hiding that you're a wholesaler**—transparency builds trust
7. **Ignoring your inspection contingency**—this is your exit strategy if the deal falls apart
8. **Trying to do everything alone**—find a mentor, join a community, ask questions
