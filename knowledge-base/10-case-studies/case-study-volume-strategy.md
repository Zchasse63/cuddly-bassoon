- **Team Size**: 7 full-time members plus virtual assistants

## Case Study Overview

Midwest Property Solutions launched in January 2022 with a single wholesaler working from a home office. By June 2023, the operation had scaled to 10+ deals monthly with a seven-person team. This case study examines exactly how they built their volume-based wholesaling business, the systems that make it work, and the critical lessons learned along the way.

The founders, Marcus and Denise Williams, specifically chose a volume strategy over a "big fish" approach because their market—Columbus, Ohio—offered abundant inventory in the $80,000-$180,000 ARV range with strong investor demand. Their philosophy: "We'd rather close ten $9,500 deals than chase two $50,000 deals that might not close."

## Market and Property Type Focus

### Geographic Focus

MPS operates exclusively within a 45-minute radius of downtown Columbus, covering:
- Columbus proper (all neighborhoods)
- Westerville, Reynoldsburg, Grove City, Hilliard
- Parts of Delaware and Licking counties

They intentionally avoid properties more than 45 minutes from their office because buyer relationships and property access become logistically challenging at greater distances.

### Property Type Specialization

The operation focuses exclusively on single-family homes meeting these criteria:
- **ARV Range**: $80,000-$180,000
- **Bedrooms**: 2-4 bedrooms
- **Condition**: Light to heavy rehab (no teardowns)
- **Lot Size**: Standard residential lots only

By maintaining this tight focus, their acquisitions team can evaluate deals quickly, and their buyers know exactly what type of inventory to expect.

### Why This Market Works for Volume

Columbus offers three characteristics essential for volume wholesaling:
1. **Affordable housing stock**: Median home prices allow entry-level investors to participate
2. **Strong rental market**: Ohio State University and major employers create consistent rental demand
3. **Active investor community**: 400+ active investors compete for deals, ensuring quick dispositions

## Buyer List Management

- **C-Buyers (262)**: Slower closings, frequent fallouts, only contacted when A/B buyers pass

## Quality vs. Quantity Trade-offs

### The Reality of Volume Strategy

Volume wholesaling requires accepting certain trade-offs:

**What You Gain**:
- Predictable monthly income
- Reduced dependence on any single deal
- Faster learning curve (more repetitions)
- Easier team training with standardized processes
- Stronger buyer relationships through consistent inventory

**What You Sacrifice**:
- Lower profit margins per deal
- Higher overhead and complexity
- More management responsibilities
- Increased marketing costs
- Greater exposure to market fluctuations

### MPS's Approach to Quality Control

Despite high volume, MPS maintains quality standards:
- Minimum $5,000 assignment fee (below this, deal gets passed to JV partner)
- Maximum 21-day close requirement from buyers
- All properties must meet minimum ARV threshold
- Two-person approval required for any deal under $7,500 fee

## Monthly Financial Breakdown

### Revenue
- Average Monthly Gross: $95,000 (10 deals × $9,500)

### Expenses
| Category | Monthly Cost |
|----------|--------------|
| Marketing (all channels) | $28,325 |
| Payroll (W-2 employees) | $38,000 |
| Virtual Assistants | $3,840 |
| Office Lease | $2,200 |
| Technology/Software | $2,023 |
| Insurance | $450 |
| Professional Services | $800 |
| Miscellaneous | $1,000 |
| **Total Expenses** | **$76,638** |

### Profitability
- **Average Monthly Net Profit**: $18,362
- **Annual Net Profit**: ~$220,000
- **Profit Margin**: 19.3%

Note: During strong months (12+ deals), net profit exceeds $40,000. During slow months (6-7 deals), the operation may break even or show small losses.

## Scalability Challenges

### Challenge 1: Lead Quality Degradation
As marketing volume increased, lead quality decreased. Solution: More sophisticated list filtering and source tracking to identify highest-converting channels.

### Challenge 2: Acquisitions Bottleneck
One acquisitions manager couldn't handle lead flow. Solution: Hired second acquisitions rep, splitting territory geographically.

### Challenge 3: Buyer Fatigue
Frequent inventory emails caused buyer disengagement. Solution: Buyer segmentation and personalized deal matching.

### Challenge 4: Cash Flow Timing
Marketing costs hit immediately; revenue arrives 30-45 days later. Solution: Maintained $75,000 operating reserve and established $50,000 credit line.

### Challenge 5: Team Turnover
Lost two key employees in Year 1. Solution: Documented all processes in SOPs, cross-trained team members, improved compensation structure.

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Systems before scale**: Every process must be documented before adding volume
2. **Marketing diversity protects revenue**: When one channel underperforms, others compensate
3. **Buyer relationships are everything**: A strong A-buyer list is more valuable than any marketing campaign
4. **Speed wins**: First to respond, first to contract, first to close
5. **Track everything**: You can't improve what you don't measure
6. **Hire slow, fire fast**: Bad hires cost more than vacancy
7. **Cash reserves are non-negotiable**: Maintain 60+ days of operating expenses
8. **Profit per deal matters less than profit per month**: Consistent volume beats occasional home runs

## When Volume Strategy Makes Sense

Volume wholesaling is the right approach when:

- Your market has abundant affordable inventory ($50K-$200K ARV)
- Strong investor community with 100+ active buyers
- You want predictable, salary-like income
- You're willing to invest in team and systems
- You have $50,000+ startup capital
- You enjoy building and managing teams
- Your market is too competitive for cherry-picking deals

Volume strategy is NOT right when:
- Working solo without plans to build team
- Limited startup capital (under $25,000)
- Market has primarily luxury inventory
- You prefer fewer, larger transactions
- You're unwilling to manage employees

## Examples

### Example Deal 1: Standard Volume Deal
- Property: 3BR/1BA ranch, 1,100 sqft
- Acquisition: $52,000 purchase price
- ARV: $125,000
- Repairs: $28,000
- Wholesale Price: $60,500
- Assignment Fee: $8,500
- Days to Close: 14
- Buyer: A-list investor (repeat buyer, 7th purchase)

### Example Deal 2: Higher-Margin Exception
- Property: 4BR/2BA colonial, 1,800 sqft
- Acquisition: $95,000 purchase price
- ARV: $195,000
- Repairs: $40,000
- Wholesale Price: $119,000
- Assignment Fee: $24,000
- Days to Close: 21
- Buyer: New investor (first purchase, now A-list)

## Common Mistakes

1. **Scaling marketing before systems are ready**: Leads get wasted when you can't process them efficiently
2. **Hiring too quickly**: Building team before deal flow supports payroll creates financial stress
3. **Ignoring buyer relationships**: Volume means nothing if you can't move inventory quickly
4. **Underestimating cash needs**: Volume operations require significant working capital
5. **Chasing every deal regardless of profit**: Minimum fee thresholds exist for a reason
6. **Neglecting lead follow-up**: In volume operations, 60%+ of deals come from follow-up, not first contact
7. **Poor list management**: Mailing to bad data wastes thousands monthly
8. **No backup acquisition reps**: Single point of failure kills deal flow during vacations or illness
9. **Skipping SOPs**: Undocumented processes can't be delegated or improved
10. **Mixing volume and big-fish strategies**: Pick one model and optimize for it
