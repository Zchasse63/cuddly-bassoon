## The Property Details

The subject property was a 1,450 square foot single-family residence located at 2847 E. Harmony Lane in Mesa, Arizona. Built in 1987, the home sat on a 6,200 square foot lot in an established neighborhood with excellent school ratings and close proximity to major employment centers.

Property condition at acquisition:
- Original roof showing significant wear (20+ years old)
- Outdated kitchen with laminate counters and white appliances
- Original HVAC system (functioning but inefficient)
- Carpet throughout with visible stains and wear
- Popcorn ceilings throughout
- Landscaping overgrown and neglected
- Pool equipment non-functional

The property had been tenant-occupied until six months prior when the last tenant moved out. It had sat vacant since, accumulating code violations and neighborhood complaints.

## How the Lead Was Generated

This deal originated from a systematic absentee owner campaign. Here's the exact process used:

**Step 1: List Building**
Pulled a list from the Maricopa County Assessor's records with these criteria:
- Property address different from owner's mailing address (absentee indicator)
- Single-family residential properties only
- Owned for 10+ years (high equity position)
- No recent sales activity within 3 years
- Property value between $250,000 and $400,000

This search yielded 847 properties matching these criteria.

**Step 2: Skip Tracing**
The list was uploaded to a skip tracing service at $0.15 per record. Total investment: $127.05. Results returned phone numbers for 673 of the 847 records (79.5% hit rate).

**Step 3: Initial Outreach**
A direct mail campaign was launched simultaneously with cold calling efforts. The postcard cost $0.45 each for 847 properties = $381.15 additional investment.

The owner of 2847 E. Harmony Lane—Robert Chen, age 67—responded to the postcard by calling the dedicated voicemail line three days after delivery.

## The Owner's Situation and Motivation

Robert Chen had inherited the property from his mother in 2003. He lived in Portland, Oregon, and had managed the property as a rental for 20 years. His story revealed multiple motivation factors:

**Primary Motivations:**
1. **Distance fatigue**: Managing a property 1,400 miles away had become increasingly difficult
2. **Recent tenant issues**: The last tenant left owing three months rent and caused damage
3. **Health concerns**: Robert had recently undergone heart surgery and wanted to simplify his life
4. **Code violations**: The city had issued notices requiring immediate attention
5. **Financial burden**: He was paying $1,847/month (mortgage, insurance, HOA, property taxes) with zero income

During the initial conversation, Robert shared: "I'm just tired. Every time the phone rings, I wonder what's broken now. My wife keeps asking why I'm stressing over a house we've never even lived in."

This revealed emotional motivation beyond financial pressure—a key indicator of deal potential.

## Initial Contact and Rapport Building

The first phone conversation lasted 23 minutes. Here's the approach that worked:

**Opening (0-3 minutes)**
Started by acknowledging his call: "Hi Robert, thanks for reaching out. I got your voicemail—sounds like you might be thinking about selling your Mesa property. Before we get into any of that, I'd love to just hear your story. What's going on with the house?"

**Active Listening (3-15 minutes)**
Let Robert talk without interruption. He shared 20 years of landlord experiences, his mother's passing, his health challenges, and his frustrations with the current situation. Notes were taken on every detail.

**Empathy Statement (15-18 minutes)**
"Robert, it sounds like this property has been more of a burden than a blessing lately, especially with everything you've been through health-wise. I completely understand wanting to simplify things."

**Soft Transition (18-23 minutes)**
"Would it be helpful if I took a look at the property and put together some options for you? No pressure at all—I just want to see if there's a way I can help solve this problem for you."

Robert agreed to provide lockbox access for a property walkthrough.

## Objections Encountered and How They Were Handled

### Objection 1: "I think it's worth at least $300,000"

**Response**: "I can definitely see why you'd think that, Robert. Some of the updated homes in your neighborhood have sold for even more. The challenge is that your property needs quite a bit of work to get to that level. Would you be open to me walking you through exactly what a buyer would need to invest to bring it up to that condition? That way you can make a fully informed decision."

After reviewing the repair estimates together, Robert understood the gap between current condition and retail value.

### Objection 2: "Maybe I should just list it with a realtor"

**Response**: "That's absolutely an option, and I'd never tell you not to explore it. Here's what I've seen happen with properties in similar condition: they sit on the MLS for 60-90 days, buyers request repair credits, deals fall through over inspection issues, and the whole process takes 4-6 months. With your code violation timeline and monthly carrying costs, you'd spend another $7,000-$11,000 just waiting. But you know your situation better than I do—what matters most to you: getting the highest possible price or getting this resolved quickly?"

Robert confirmed speed and certainty were his priorities.

### Objection 3: "I need to talk to my wife"

**Response**: "Absolutely, Robert. This is a big decision and you should definitely discuss it together. Would it help if I sent over a summary of everything we discussed so you both have the same information? When would be a good time for me to follow up?"

Sent a detailed email recap within one hour. Followed up exactly when scheduled, 48 hours later.

## Negotiation Process and Timeline

**Day 1**: Initial call, gathered motivation details
**Day 4**: Property walkthrough, documented all repairs needed
**Day 6**: Sent initial offer of $195,000 with detailed repair breakdown
**Day 8**: Robert countered at $240,000
**Day 9**: Called to discuss further, increased offer to $208,000 with explanation of investor margins
**Day 12**: Robert countered at $225,000
**Day 14**: Final offer of $215,000, explained this was maximum based on numbers
**Day 17**: Robert accepted, contract signed

The key to this negotiation was patience and education. Each counter-offer included a detailed breakdown showing exactly how the numbers were calculated using the MAO formula:

**MAO Calculation Shared with Seller:**
- ARV: $345,000
- Multiplied by 70%: $241,500
- Minus Repairs ($55,000): $186,500
- Wholesale margin: $28,500
- Maximum offer to seller: $215,000

By showing complete transparency, Robert understood why higher offers weren't possible while still seeing value in the speed and certainty offered.

## Final Offer and Acceptance

The executed purchase agreement included these terms:
- Purchase price: $215,000
- Earnest money deposit: $2,500 (held by title company)
- Inspection period: 14 days
- Closing date: 30 days from execution
- Property sold as-is
- Seller to provide clear title

## Assignment to Buyer Process

**Day 18-21**: Property marketed to cash buyer list via email blast, text campaign, and direct calls to top 15 active buyers
**Day 22**: Received 4 offers ranging from $228,000 to $237,000
**Day 23**: Negotiated with top bidder, accepted $233,500 assignment
**Day 24**: Assignment agreement executed, collected $5,000 non-refundable assignment deposit
**Day 25**: Connected buyer with title company, opened escrow

The end buyer was an experienced fix-and-flip investor who had purchased 3 previous deals. Their numbers:
- Purchase: $233,500
- Repairs: $55,000
- Holding/selling costs: $25,000
- Total investment: $313,500
- Expected ARV: $345,000
- Projected profit: $31,500

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Absentee owners with long ownership periods often have significant equity and emotional fatigue**—both are deal drivers

2. **The first call should be 80% listening, 20% talking**—Robert's story revealed every motivation needed to structure the right offer

3. **Transparency builds trust faster than salesmanship**—showing the actual MAO calculation eliminated suspicion

4. **Speed of follow-up matters**—responding to Robert's voicemail within 2 hours set a professional tone

5. **Document everything during the walkthrough**—photos of every defect supported repair estimates during negotiation

## What Made This Deal Successful

Three factors combined to create this successful outcome:

**Factor 1: Targeted Lead Generation**
The list criteria specifically identified owners likely to have equity (10+ year ownership) and motivation (out-of-state absentee). This wasn't random marketing—it was strategic targeting.

**Factor 2: Motivation Over Price**
By identifying that Robert prioritized certainty and speed over maximum price, the conversation shifted from "how much" to "how fast." This reframe made $215,000 acceptable where it might have been rejected otherwise.

**Factor 3: Strong Buyer Relationships**
Having a pre-built list of active buyers meant the property was assigned within 6 days of contract signing. The $233,500 price was strong because multiple buyers competed.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Leading with price on the first call**—this kills deals before understanding motivation
2. **Failing to follow up within 24-48 hours**—motivated sellers often have short decision windows
3. **Skipping the property walkthrough**—repair estimates without visual confirmation lead to renegotiations
4. **Not explaining your role clearly**—Robert understood from day one that the contract would be assigned
5. **Overestimating ARV**—conservative ARV projections protect your reputation with buyers
6. **Under-budgeting repairs**—pad repair estimates by 10-15% for unexpected issues
7. **Ignoring seller's emotional needs**—Robert wanted to feel good about the decision, not just get a check
8. **Taking too long to make offers**—speed demonstrates seriousness and respect for seller's time
9. **Not having title company relationships ready**—this deal closed smoothly because the title company was briefed before contract execution
10. **Failing to collect non-refundable deposits from buyers**—the $5,000 deposit protected against buyer fallout
