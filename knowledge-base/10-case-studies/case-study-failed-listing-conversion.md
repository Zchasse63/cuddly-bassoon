## The Property: Background and Listing History

This deal originated from a property at 4847 Ridgemont Drive in Westerville, Ohio—a 1,850 square foot split-level home built in 1987. The property featured four bedrooms, two and a half bathrooms, an attached two-car garage, and sat on a 0.28-acre lot in a middle-class subdivision.

### Original Listing Details

The seller, Margaret Thornton (age 58), listed the property on November 3, 2023, with a local real estate agent. Here's the listing timeline:

| Date | Event | Price |
|------|-------|-------|
| Nov 3, 2023 | Original listing | $299,900 |
| Dec 15, 2023 | First price reduction | $289,900 |
| Jan 22, 2024 | Second price reduction | $279,900 |
| Mar 10, 2024 | Listing expired | N/A |

**Total Days on Market**: 127 days with zero offers received.

### Why the Listing Failed to Sell

During my initial conversation with Margaret, I identified five specific reasons this property sat unsold:

**1. Overpricing from Day One**
The agent priced based on comparable sales from 6 months prior without accounting for market softening. Recent comparable sales in the area ranged from $255,000 to $275,000 for similar properties in good condition.

**2. Deferred Maintenance Issues**
The property needed approximately $35,000-$40,000 in repairs:
- Roof showing significant wear (12 years old, 5+ years past expected replacement)
- Original HVAC system from 1987
- Dated kitchen with laminate counters and older appliances
- Carpet throughout showing heavy wear patterns
- One bathroom had water damage around the tub surround

**3. Poor Marketing Presentation**
The listing photos were taken with a cell phone, rooms appeared cluttered, and several photos were dark or unflattering. No professional staging or decluttering occurred.

**4. Limited Showing Availability**
Margaret worked from home and restricted showings to evenings and weekends only with 24-hour notice. Buyer's agents reported difficulty scheduling appointments.

**5. Market Timing**
The listing launched just as mortgage rates peaked above 7.5%, significantly reducing buyer pool activity in this price range.

## Lead Identification and Contact Strategy

### How I Found This Lead

I pull expired listing data from the MLS every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday morning at 7:00 AM. My criteria targets:

- Expired or withdrawn listings
- Days on market greater than 90
- Price reductions during listing period
- Properties in my target zip codes

Margaret's listing appeared in my March 11th pull—one day after expiration.

### Initial Contact Approach

I use a three-touch contact system for expired listings:

**Day 1 (March 11)**: Handwritten yellow letter mailed via USPS
**Day 3 (March 13)**: Voicemail left (no answer)
**Day 5 (March 15)**: Direct phone call—Margaret answered

My opening script:
> "Hi Margaret, this is David with Buckeye Home Solutions. I noticed your home on Ridgemont Drive just came off the market, and I wanted to reach out because I work with homeowners in exactly this situation. I'm not a real estate agent trying to list your home—I actually buy properties directly for cash. Do you have two minutes to hear how that might help your situation?"

Margaret's response was immediate and emotional: "I'm so frustrated. I've been trying to sell this house for four months, and now I'm supposed to start a new job in North Carolina in two weeks."

That single sentence told me everything I needed to know about her motivation level.

## Understanding the Seller's Emotional State

Margaret's frustrations ran deep after 127 days of unsuccessful marketing:

### Primary Frustrations Expressed
- "I feel like I wasted four months of my life"
- "Every showing felt like an invasion with no result"
- "My agent kept saying 'just be patient' while nothing happened"
- "I've already accepted the position and put a deposit on a rental in Charlotte"
- "My husband passed away two years ago—I just want a fresh start"

### Underlying Motivations
- **Time Pressure**: Job start date of April 1st was non-negotiable
- **Financial Stress**: Facing potential dual housing payments
- **Emotional Exhaustion**: Four months of keeping house "show ready"
- **Life Transition**: Widow seeking new chapter, not anchored to property
- **Trust Issues**: Felt let down by traditional real estate process

Understanding these emotional factors proved essential to structuring an offer she would accept.

## The Appointment and Analysis

I met Margaret at the property on March 17th. My walkthrough confirmed the repair estimates and revealed additional issues not visible in listing photos.

### Repair Cost Analysis
| Item | Estimated Cost |
|------|----------------|
| Roof replacement | $12,500 |
| HVAC replacement | $8,500 |
| Kitchen updates | $7,500 |
| Flooring throughout | $4,500 |
| Bathroom repairs | $2,500 |
| Paint interior | $3,000 |
| Miscellaneous | $3,500 |
| **Total** | **$42,000** |

### After Repair Value (ARV) Calculation
Based on recent comparable sales of renovated properties:
- 4892 Ridgemont Dr: $298,000 (sold Feb 2024)
- 4721 Ridgemont Dr: $305,000 (sold Jan 2024)
- 4803 Summit View: $295,000 (sold Mar 2024)

**Estimated ARV**: $298,000

### Maximum Allowable Offer Calculation
Using the 70% rule:
$298,000 (ARV) × 0.70 = $208,600
$208,600 - $42,000 (repairs) = $166,600 MAO

However, this was a clean title situation with a motivated seller—I determined I could offer slightly above MAO and still have room for assignment.

**Initial Offer**: $180,000
**Final Negotiated Price**: $185,000

## Overcoming the "I'll Just Try Again" Objection

When I presented my initial offer of $180,000, Margaret's first response was predictable:

> "That's so much less than what I was asking. Maybe I should just try listing again with a different agent who'll actually market it right."

Here's exactly how I addressed this objection:

### Step 1: Acknowledge and Validate
"I completely understand that reaction, Margaret. $180,000 does look very different from $279,000 on paper. You absolutely have the right to relist, and if that's what feels right, I respect that decision."

### Step 2: Introduce Reality Factors
"Can I share what I'm seeing in the market data, just so you have complete information before deciding?"

### Step 3: Present the Net Proceeds Comparison
I pulled out my pre-prepared net sheet and walked through both scenarios side by side.

## The Net Proceeds Analysis That Closed the Deal

I created a detailed comparison showing Margaret what she would actually receive in each scenario:

### Scenario A: Relist with New Agent

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Realistic sale price (based on condition) | $245,000 |
| Less: Agent commission (6%) | -$14,700 |
| Less: Seller closing costs (2%) | -$4,900 |
| Less: Repairs to list (minimum) | -$8,000 |
| Less: 90-day holding costs | -$5,400 |
| Less: Price negotiation (typical 3%) | -$7,350 |
| **Net Proceeds** | **$204,650** |
| **Timeframe** | 4-6 months |
| **Certainty** | Uncertain |

### Scenario B: Accept Cash Offer

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Purchase price | $185,000 |
| Less: Closing costs (we cover) | $0 |
| Less: Agent commission | $0 |
| Less: Repairs | $0 |
| Less: Holding costs | $0 |
| **Net Proceeds** | **$185,000** |
| **Timeframe** | 14-21 days |
| **Certainty** | Guaranteed |

### The Critical Conversation

"Margaret, if everything goes perfectly with relisting—you find a buyer quickly, inspections go smoothly, financing doesn't fall through—you might net about $20,000 more. But here's my concern for your situation specifically:

Your job starts April 1st. It's now March 17th. Even if you listed today and got an offer tomorrow, a financed buyer needs 30-45 days to close. You'd be starting your new job while managing a real estate transaction 500 miles away.

With my offer, you'll have a check in your hand by March 31st. You can start your new chapter with zero loose ends. What's that certainty worth to you?"

Margaret was quiet for a long moment. Then she said, "Can you do $185,000?"

I agreed, and we signed the purchase agreement that evening.

## Timeline and Urgency Factors

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| March 10 | Listing expired |
| March 11 | Lead identified in data pull |
| March 15 | First live phone conversation |
| March 17 | Property appointment |
| March 17 | Purchase agreement signed at $185,000 |
| March 19 | Title search initiated |
| March 21 | Buyer marketed to cash buyer list |
| March 23 | End buyer identified (FlipRight Investments) |
| March 25 | Assignment agreement signed at $197,500 |
| April 8 | Closing completed |

**Total days from lead to close**: 28 days
**Total days from contract to close**: 22 days

## Buyer Matching Process

I maintain a cash buyer list segmented by:
- Property type preferences
- Price range capabilities
- Geographic focus areas
- Renovation capacity

For this property, I sent details to 14 qualified buyers who met these criteria:
- Active in Columbus metro area
- Purchase capacity $150,000-$250,000
- Experienced with 1980s split-level renovations

### Response Results
- 6 buyers requested property information packages
- 3 buyers scheduled property walkthroughs
- 2 buyers submitted offers
- 1 buyer (FlipRight Investments) matched at $197,500

### End Buyer Analysis
FlipRight's numbers:
- Purchase: $197,500
- Renovation budget: $42,000
- Holding costs (4 months): $8,000
- Selling costs (6%): $17,880
- Total investment: $265,380
- Expected ARV: $298,000
- Projected profit: $32,620 (12.3% ROI)

## Deal Structure and Wholesale Fee

**Purchase Agreement**: $185,000 (with Margaret)
**Assignment Agreement**: $197,500 (with FlipRight Investments)
**Assignment Fee**: $12,500

Assignment fee as percentage of spread: 100% (full assignment)
Assignment fee as percentage of end buyer price: 6.3%

This fee was disclosed to both parties. Margaret understood I would profit from the transaction, and FlipRight's numbers worked at $197,500.

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Speed Beats Competition
I contacted Margaret within 5 days of expiration while she was still emotionally processing the failed listing. Waiting even one week might have meant competing with other investors or a new listing agent.

### 2. Listen Before Presenting Numbers
Margaret told me her exact timeline and motivation in the first phone call. This intelligence shaped every subsequent interaction.

### 3. Net Sheets Close Deals
The visual comparison of scenarios gave Margaret a framework to make a logical decision during an emotional time.

### 4. Certainty Has Monetary Value
Margaret accepted roughly $20,000 less than a theoretical best-case traditional sale because certainty and speed had tangible value to her specific situation.

### 5. Expired Listings Require Empathy
These sellers feel failed by the process. Positioning yourself as a solution—not another salesperson—builds trust rapidly.

## Replicable Strategies from This Deal

1. **Pull expired data 3x weekly** at consistent times
2. **Use three-touch contact system** (mail, voicemail, live call)
3. **Identify motivation in first conversation** before discussing price
4. **Prepare net sheet comparisons** before every appointment
5. **Price offers to leave room** for negotiation and assignment
6. **Maintain segmented buyer list** for fast disposition
7. **Control timeline expectations** from first contact

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Leading with price**: Never mention your offer before understanding seller motivation
2. **Insulting the agent**: Margaret's agent underperformed, but criticizing them creates defensiveness
3. **Rushing the appointment**: I spent 90 minutes with Margaret—relationship first, numbers second
4. **Using round numbers**: $185,000 sounds calculated; $180,000 sounds arbitrary
5. **Ignoring emotional factors**: Failed listings involve ego, frustration, and stress—acknowledge these
6. **Overpromising timelines**: I said 14-21 days and closed in 22—underpromise and overdeliver
7. **Hiding your profit**: Transparency about your assignment fee prevents closing table surprises
8. **Failing to follow up**: Most expired listing leads require 3-7 touches before responding
