# Case Study: Winning a $18,000 Assignment Fee Against 7 Competing Investors in Dallas-Fort Worth

## Quick Reference

- **Market:** Dallas-Fort Worth Metro (highly competitive, investor-saturated)
- **Property:** 3BR/2BA ranch in Arlington, TX with significant deferred maintenance
- **Competition:** 7 other investors actively pursuing the same motivated seller
- **Winning Strategy:** Relationship-first approach combined with flexible closing timeline
- **Purchase Price:** $180,000 (56% of ARV)
- **Assignment Fee:** $18,000
- **Timeline:** 14 days from first contact to signed contract
- **Key Differentiator:** Solving the seller's moving logistics problem, not just offering cash
- **Critical Lesson:** The highest offer doesn't always win—understanding seller priorities does
- **Outcome:** Seller rejected a $188,000 offer from a competitor to accept our $180,000 offer

## Market Characteristics and Competition Level

The Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex represents one of the most competitive wholesale markets in the United States. During the period of this deal (Q3 2024), market conditions included:

**Competition Metrics:**
- Over 3,200 active real estate investors in the DFW metro
- Average of 12-15 direct mail pieces received by distressed property owners weekly
- 47% increase in investor cold calling activity year-over-year
- Average days on market for distressed properties: 8 days before receiving multiple offers

**Market Dynamics:**
- Strong rental demand keeping investor appetite high
- ARV appreciation of 4.2% annually despite higher interest rates
- Fix-and-flip profit margins compressed to 12-18% (down from 20-25% pre-2022)
- Institutional buyers (hedge funds, iBuyers) competing for the same inventory

This wasn't a market where you could win on price alone. Every investor had access to the same comps, the same repair cost estimates, and the same understanding of the numbers. Differentiation required creativity.

## Property Details and Opportunity

**Property Profile:**
- **Address:** [Anonymized] Oak Street, Arlington, TX 76010
- **Type:** Single-family ranch, built 1978
- **Size:** 1,847 square feet, 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms
- **Lot:** 0.19 acres, fully fenced backyard
- **Condition:** Significant deferred maintenance, estate property

**The Opportunity:**
The property came through our driving-for-dollars campaign. I spotted the telltale signs: overgrown lawn, newspapers piled on the porch, and a dated "No Soliciting" sign. Skip tracing revealed the owner, Margaret, was a 72-year-old widow living in the property alone. Her husband had passed 18 months prior, and she was overwhelmed by the home's maintenance demands.

**Property Numbers:**
- **After Repair Value (ARV):** $320,000 (based on 4 comparable sales within 0.5 miles)
- **Estimated Repairs:** $45,000 (roof, HVAC, kitchen/bath updates, flooring, paint)
- **As-Is Value:** Approximately $190,000-$200,000

## Competition Assessment: 7 Active Investors

Within 48 hours of my first conversation with Margaret, I discovered the extent of the competition:

1. **Two local wholesalers** had already visited the property
2. **One iBuyer company** had submitted a written offer of $175,000
3. **Three fix-and-flip investors** were scheduling appointments
4. **One buy-and-hold investor** had made a verbal offer of $185,000

I learned this information directly from Margaret during our second phone call. She was transparent about feeling overwhelmed by the attention and wasn't sure who to trust.

**Competitor Offer Range:** $175,000 - $188,000

The highest offer came from a local flipper who offered $188,000 cash with a 21-day close. On paper, this should have won the deal. It didn't.

## Differentiation Strategy: Solving Problems, Not Just Buying Houses

My differentiation strategy centered on one principle: **discover what matters beyond the money.**

During my first in-person meeting with Margaret, I spent 45 minutes listening before discussing any numbers. I asked questions like:

- "What's been the hardest part about maintaining this home alone?"
- "If we could solve this situation perfectly, what would that look like for you?"
- "Where are you planning to go after you sell?"

Through this conversation, I discovered Margaret's real concerns:

1. **Moving logistics:** She had 46 years of belongings and no family nearby to help
2. **Timeline anxiety:** She wanted to move before her granddaughter's wedding in 8 weeks
3. **Sentimental attachment:** She needed to feel the home would be "taken care of"
4. **Trust issues:** A previous contractor had overcharged her for roof repairs

None of the other investors had uncovered these priorities. They focused exclusively on price and speed.

## Relationship Building That Won the Deal

**First Contact (Day 1):** Cold call introduction, 12-minute conversation focused entirely on her situation—no pitch.

**Second Call (Day 3):** Follow-up call to check on her. Mentioned I'd researched senior moving services in the area if she needed recommendations.

**First Visit (Day 5):** In-person meeting at the property. Brought my wife to help Margaret feel more comfortable. Walked the property but spent more time looking at family photos she wanted to share.

**Second Visit (Day 8):** Returned with a written offer AND a folder containing three senior moving company quotes I'd personally obtained for her, ranging from $2,800-$4,200 for full-service packing and moving.

**The Trust Moment:** During our second visit, Margaret mentioned she was worried about her late husband's workshop tools. I offered to connect her with an estate sale company that specializes in tool collections. This gesture—worth maybe 20 minutes of my research time—became the deciding factor.

## Offer Structure and Terms

**Our Offer:**
- **Purchase Price:** $180,000
- **Earnest Money Deposit:** $5,000 (higher than typical to demonstrate commitment)
- **Inspection Period:** 10 days (standard)
- **Closing Timeline:** 45 days (not 21 days—intentionally longer)
- **Special Terms:** Seller may leave any unwanted items; buyer handles all disposal

**Why 45 Days Instead of 21?**
Every other investor offered quick closes—14 to 30 days. But Margaret didn't want fast; she wanted manageable. A 45-day close gave her time to:
- Sort through belongings without pressure
- Coordinate with the moving company
- Attend her granddaughter's wedding without stress
- Feel in control of the process

## Why the Seller Chose Us Over Competitors

Margaret later told me exactly why she chose our offer despite it being $8,000 less than the highest bid:

> "Everyone else came in talking about their company and how fast they could close. You came in asking about my grandchildren. You brought solutions to problems I didn't even know I had. I trusted you'd actually do what you said."

**The winning factors ranked by Margaret:**
1. Personal connection and trust (50% of decision)
2. Help with moving logistics problem (25% of decision)
3. Flexible timeline that matched her needs (15% of decision)
4. Higher earnest money showing commitment (10% of decision)

Price was not mentioned in her decision criteria.

## Timeline and Urgency Factors

| Day | Action | Result |
|-----|--------|--------|
| 1 | Initial cold call | 12-minute rapport-building conversation |
| 3 | Follow-up call | Learned about competition and moving concerns |
| 5 | First property visit | Deepened relationship, assessed repairs |
| 8 | Second visit with written offer | Presented offer with moving company research |
| 10 | Verbal acceptance | Margaret agreed to our terms |
| 14 | Signed purchase agreement | Contract executed with 45-day close |
| 16 | Property marketed to buyers | Sent to 847 buyers on our list |
| 19 | Accepted assignment from cash buyer | $198,000 purchase price |
| 52 | Closing | Transaction completed, all parties satisfied |

## Buyer Competition and Selection

With the property under contract, I immediately marketed to our buyer list:

**Buyer Response:**
- 847 buyers received the deal
- 23 expressed interest (2.7% response rate)
- 9 scheduled property viewings
- 4 submitted written offers

**Offer Range from Buyers:**
- Lowest: $191,000
- Highest: $202,000

**Selected Buyer:** We chose a buyer who offered $198,000—not the highest offer—because:
- Verified proof of funds ($340,000 in checking account)
- Track record of 12 closed transactions with other wholesalers
- Willingness to honor the full 45-day timeline Margaret needed
- Cash offer with no contingencies beyond clear title

The highest bidder at $202,000 was a newer investor with unverified funds and a history of renegotiating after inspections. The additional $4,000 wasn't worth the risk of the deal falling through.

## Wholesale Fee and Deal Outcome

**Final Numbers:**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Purchase Price (from seller) | $180,000 |
| Assignment Fee | $18,000 |
| End Buyer Purchase Price | $198,000 |
| Estimated ARV | $320,000 |
| Estimated Repairs | $45,000 |
| End Buyer's Potential Profit | ~$62,000 |

**All Parties Satisfied:**
- **Seller (Margaret):** Received fair price, stress-free move, trusted buyer
- **End Buyer:** Acquired property at 62% of ARV with strong profit margin
- **Wholesaler (Us):** Earned $18,000 assignment fee on 14 days of work

## Common Mistakes in Competitive Markets

1. **Leading with price instead of relationship:** Offering more money when you haven't established trust rarely wins against a trusted lower offer.

2. **Assuming sellers want the fastest close:** Many motivated sellers are motivated by factors other than speed. Always ask.

3. **Failing to research seller problems beyond the property:** The real deal-winning information often has nothing to do with the house itself.

4. **Submitting generic offers:** Boilerplate contracts without personalized terms signal you're just another investor.

5. **Ignoring competitor activity:** Not asking sellers about other offers leaves you negotiating blind.

6. **Underinvesting in earnest money:** In competitive situations, a $1,000 EMD signals less commitment than $5,000.

7. **Choosing buyers purely on price:** The highest offer means nothing if the buyer can't or won't close.

8. **Rushing the seller relationship:** Two visits over 8 days built more trust than competitors' single appointments.

9. **Neglecting follow-through on small promises:** I actually obtained those moving quotes. Competitors who made vague promises didn't follow through.

10. **Failing to stay in touch post-contract:** I called Margaret weekly until closing. She referred me to two neighbors.

## Key Lessons Learned

**Lesson 1:** Competitive markets require differentiation beyond dollars. When everyone has the same numbers, the relationship becomes the variable.

**Lesson 2:** The discovery phase should be longer than the presentation phase. Spend 70% of your time understanding and 30% presenting solutions.

**Lesson 3:** Solve problems the seller didn't ask you to solve. The moving company research took 20 minutes and was worth $18,000.

**Lesson 4:** Flexible terms can be more valuable than higher prices. Margaret valued the 45-day timeline more than $8,000.

**Lesson 5:** Reliable buyers are more valuable than high-paying buyers. Choosing the verified buyer at $198,000 over the risky $202,000 offer protected the entire deal.

## Strategies for Competitive Markets

1. **Invest in relationship speed, not transaction speed:** Contact leads within 5 minutes but take your time building rapport.

2. **Create a "problem solver" file:** Maintain contacts for moving companies, estate sale services, cleanout crews, and elder care resources.

3. **Increase earnest money deposits:** Budget for $3,000-$5,000 EMDs in competitive situations.

4. **Conduct thorough seller discovery:** Use a 15-question discovery framework in every conversation.

5. **Follow up with value, not pressure:** Each touchpoint should offer something helpful, not just "Are you ready to sell?"

6. **Build a deep, verified buyer list:** Quality of buyers matters more than quantity in competitive markets.

7. **Document and share testimonials:** Margaret's story became a powerful trust-builder for future seller conversations.
