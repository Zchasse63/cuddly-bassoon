# Case Study: $42,500 Assignment Fee on a Luxury Scottsdale Estate

## Quick Reference

- **Property**: 4,200 sq ft single-family home in North Scottsdale, Arizona
- **Contract Price**: $685,000
- **Assignment Price**: $727,500
- **After Repair Value (ARV)**: $1,050,000
- **Assignment Fee Earned**: $42,500
- **Lead Source**: Direct mail to probate filings
- **Days from Contract to Close**: 34 days
- **Key Success Factor**: Building trust with multiple heirs and having pre-qualified luxury buyers ready
- **Lesson**: High-dollar deals require deeper relationships, longer conversations, and premium buyer networks

## Property Details and Market Overview

This deal occurred in North Scottsdale, Arizona—a luxury market known for golf course communities, mountain views, and high-end finishes. The property was a 4,200 square foot Spanish-style home built in 2001, located in the Grayhawk subdivision.

**Property Specifications:**
- 5 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms
- 3-car garage with workshop space
- Pool and spa (non-functional)
- 0.42-acre lot backing to common area
- Original kitchen and bathrooms (never updated)
- Deferred maintenance: roof repairs, HVAC replacement, pool resurfacing

The Scottsdale luxury market was experiencing 8% year-over-year appreciation, with updated homes in Grayhawk selling between $240-260 per square foot. This property, in its current condition, would struggle to sell traditionally due to its dated condition and the complexity of the estate situation.

## What Made This a High-Value Opportunity

Three factors converged to create exceptional wholesale value:

**1. Significant Equity Spread**
The property was owned free and clear (inherited). Updated comparable sales supported a $1,050,000 ARV, while the property's condition justified a purchase price of $685,000—creating a substantial spread.

**2. Motivated Seller Situation**
The property sat in a living trust with three beneficiaries who lived in different states. None wanted to manage renovations or deal with selling traditionally. They needed simplicity more than maximum price.

**3. Limited Competition**
Most wholesalers avoid properties above $500,000 because they require different buyer pools and more sophisticated negotiations. This created an opportunity for those willing to operate at higher levels.

**Deal Math:**
- ARV: $1,050,000
- Estimated Repairs: $165,000
- Buyer's Desired Profit (15%): $157,500
- Maximum Allowable Offer to Buyer: $727,500
- My Contract Price: $685,000
- Assignment Fee: $42,500

## How the Lead Was Generated

This lead came from a **probate direct mail campaign** targeting estates valued above $400,000 in Maricopa County. The mailer was a handwritten-style letter (printed) sent 45 days after the probate was filed.

**Campaign Details:**
- List source: County probate filings cross-referenced with property records
- Filter: Properties with assessed values above $400,000
- Mail piece: Yellow letter with personal tone
- Follow-up: Three additional touches over 60 days

The successor trustee, Michael, called from the third mailer. He mentioned receiving "dozens of letters" but appreciated that mine referenced the specific property address and didn't use aggressive language like "CASH OFFER TODAY."

## The Seller's Unique Situation

Michael was one of three siblings who inherited their mother's home after she passed from a lengthy illness. Here's what made the situation complex:

- **Geographic separation**: Michael lived in Chicago, his sister in Seattle, and his brother in Austin
- **Emotional attachment**: Their mother lived in the home for 22 years
- **Decision paralysis**: The siblings disagreed on whether to renovate and sell traditionally or sell as-is
- **Carrying costs**: The property was costing $4,200/month in taxes, HOA, utilities, and maintenance
- **Timeline pressure**: Michael's brother needed his inheritance share to pay medical bills

The siblings had been paying carrying costs for seven months before contacting me. They'd already spent over $29,000 maintaining an empty house while trying to agree on a path forward.

## Challenges of High-Dollar Negotiations

Negotiating a $685,000 purchase isn't the same as negotiating a $150,000 purchase. Here's what made this challenging:

**1. Multiple Decision Makers**
Every conversation required alignment among three people in three time zones. I scheduled two conference calls with all siblings present to ensure everyone heard the same information.

**2. Higher Sophistication**
These sellers weren't naive. Michael was a financial analyst who researched comparable sales, understood renovation costs, and questioned my numbers. I had to be completely transparent with my analysis.

**3. Larger Numbers Feel Different**
Even though the percentage discount was similar to smaller deals (roughly 65% of ARV), hearing "$685,000" made sellers second-guess themselves more than "$185,000" would.

**4. Attorney Involvement**
The family's estate attorney reviewed the purchase agreement. I welcomed this because it built trust, but it added three days to the timeline.

## Building Trust for Large Transactions

You cannot close high-dollar deals without genuine trust. Here's how I built it:

**Radical Transparency**
I shared my comparable sales analysis showing how I arrived at my offer. I explained that I would assign the contract to an investor and showed them what assignment fees typically look like. No hidden agendas.

**Face-to-Face Meeting**
I flew to the property and met Michael in person during his visit from Chicago. This $400 trip investment was crucial—we spent two hours walking the property and discussing his mother's life there. Business is built on relationships.

**References on Request**
I provided contact information for two previous sellers (with their permission) who could vouch for my professionalism. One was another probate situation.

**Flexible Timeline**
I gave them a 45-day inspection period instead of the standard 14 days. They needed time to finalize trust documents and coordinate among siblings. This flexibility demonstrated I wasn't trying to pressure them.

## Building a Buyer Pool for High-End Deals

Standard wholesale buyers often can't close deals above $500,000. You need a specialized buyer list:

**Who Buys Luxury Wholesale Deals:**
- Established fix-and-flip operators with private money access
- Small development companies pivoting to renovations
- High-net-worth individuals seeking investment projects
- Family offices allocating to real estate

**How I Built This List:**
- Attended luxury real estate investment meetups
- Connected with hard money lenders who fund $500K+ loans
- Researched recent cash purchases of distressed luxury properties in MLS
- Asked existing buyers for referrals to investors who operate at higher price points

My buyer, Steven, was a second-generation flipper who'd completed over 40 luxury renovations in Scottsdale. He was pre-qualified with a private lender for up to $900,000 in acquisition costs.

## Due Diligence Process

High-dollar deals require more thorough due diligence because mistakes are amplified:

**My Due Diligence (Before Contract):**
- Verified trust ownership through title company
- Confirmed all three beneficiaries had authority to sell
- Obtained preliminary repair estimates from two contractors
- Pulled permits and verified no outstanding code violations
- Researched HOA for any pending special assessments

**Buyer's Due Diligence:**
- Full property inspection ($800)
- Roof certification inspection
- Pool and equipment assessment
- Detailed contractor walkthrough with scope of work
- HOA document review

I provided Steven with my contractor estimates upfront, which he appreciated even though he verified everything independently.

## Deal Structure and Fee Justification

**Contract Details:**
- Purchase price: $685,000
- Earnest money deposit: $10,000 (higher than typical due to price)
- Inspection period: 45 days
- Closing timeline: 14 days after inspection period
- Title company: Held by neutral third party specializing in investment transactions

**Fee Justification:**
My $42,500 assignment fee (6.2% of contract price) was justified because:
- I sourced an off-market opportunity unavailable through traditional channels
- I navigated complex multi-party negotiations
- I provided a vetted, ready buyer who could close quickly
- I handled coordination between sellers, buyer, and title company
- The buyer still had 15% projected profit margin after repairs

Steven's projected numbers:
- Acquisition: $727,500
- Renovations: $165,000
- Holding/closing costs: $45,000
- Total investment: $937,500
- ARV: $1,050,000
- Projected profit: $112,500 (12% of ARV)

## Timeline and Complexity Management

**Day 1-3**: Initial seller conversation and property research
**Day 4**: Conference call with all three siblings
**Day 5-7**: Prepared analysis package and formal offer
**Day 8**: In-person meeting with Michael at property
**Day 9**: Verbal acceptance
**Day 10-14**: Attorney review and contract execution
**Day 15-20**: Marketed to qualified buyer list (sent to 12 buyers)
**Day 21**: Received three offers; negotiated with Steven
**Day 22-25**: Steven's due diligence period
**Day 26**: Signed assignment agreement
**Day 27-34**: Title work and closing coordination
**Day 34**: Closed; assignment fee wired

Managing this timeline required daily communication with all parties. I used a shared Google Doc to keep everyone updated on milestones.

## Key Lessons Learned

**1. High-dollar deals require high-touch communication**
I spent 10+ hours on the phone with this seller family. That investment was worth $4,250 per hour.

**2. Your buyer list is your business**
Without Steven, this deal might not have closed. Cultivating relationships with capable buyers is essential before you need them.

**3. Transparency beats tactics**
Trying to use high-pressure techniques would have destroyed this deal. Educated sellers respect honesty.

**4. Fly to the property**
For deals above $25,000 in potential fees, invest in face-to-face relationships. It differentiates you from every other mailer in their stack.

**5. Longer inspection periods create seller confidence**
Rushed timelines make sophisticated sellers nervous. Flexibility demonstrates professionalism.

## Scaling to Bigger Deals

If you want to consistently close high-dollar wholesale deals:

- **Upgrade your marketing lists** to target higher-value properties and complex situations (probate, divorce, estate)
- **Build a luxury buyer database** before you have deals—attend high-end investor events, connect with private lenders
- **Develop your negotiation skills** to handle sophisticated sellers who research everything
- **Increase your earnest money capacity** to demonstrate seriousness on larger contracts
- **Cultivate professional referral relationships** with estate attorneys, CPAs, and financial advisors
- **Study luxury market comparables** so you can speak confidently about values

## Common Mistakes in High-Dollar Deals

1. **Using the same buyer list** as you'd use for $100K properties—they can't perform
2. **Rushing sellers** who need time to coordinate among multiple decision makers
3. **Hiding your assignment fee** from sophisticated sellers who will discover it anyway
4. **Under-estimating repair costs** because the percentages feel different at higher price points
5. **Skipping in-person meetings** when the fee justifies the travel investment
6. **Failing to verify authority** when dealing with estates, trusts, or multiple owners
7. **Using aggressive marketing language** that repels sophisticated sellers
8. **Neglecting attorney involvement** that could actually strengthen your deal
9. **Underpricing your assignment fee** because you're uncomfortable with large numbers
10. **Not having proof of funds ready** from qualified buyers before marketing
