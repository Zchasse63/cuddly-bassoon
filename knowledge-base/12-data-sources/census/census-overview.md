# Census Data - Demographics & Geographic Boundaries

## Overview

Census data provides demographic information and geographic boundaries used for market analysis, neighborhood assessment, and buyer targeting. This data helps identify promising markets and understand local dynamics.

## Data Types Available

### 1. Demographic Data

Population and household characteristics by geographic area.

**Population Metrics:**
- Total population
- Population density
- Population growth rate
- Age distribution

**Household Metrics:**
- Total households
- Average household size
- Owner-occupied vs. renter-occupied
- Median household income
- Poverty rate

**Housing Metrics:**
- Total housing units
- Vacancy rate
- Median home value
- Median rent
- Housing age distribution

### 2. Geographic Boundaries

Standardized geographic areas for analysis.

**Census Geographies:**
- **Tract**: ~4,000 people, best for neighborhood analysis
- **Block Group**: ~600-3,000 people, detailed local data
- **ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)**: Approximate ZIP boundaries
- **County**: County boundaries
- **Metro Area**: Metropolitan statistical areas

## How Data is Used in the Platform

### Market Selection

Use demographic data to identify promising markets:

**Strong Wholesaling Markets:**
- Population growth > 1% annually
- Median income $50K-$100K
- Owner-occupied rate 50-70%
- Moderate vacancy rate (5-10%)

**Challenging Markets:**
- Population decline
- Very high income (retail buyers dominate)
- Very low income (limited buyer pool)
- High vacancy rate (oversupply)

### Buyer Matching

Different demographics attract different buyers:

| Demographic Profile | Buyer Type |
|--------------------|------------|
| Young professionals, urban | Flippers, landlords |
| Families, suburban | Flippers, owner-occupants |
| Retirees, rural | Cash buyers, vacation |
| Students, college area | Landlords, student housing |

### Neighborhood Analysis

Combine with property data for context:

**Gentrifying Areas (Opportunity):**
- Rising income levels
- Declining vacancy
- Increasing owner-occupancy
- Permit activity increasing

**Declining Areas (Caution):**
- Falling income levels
- Rising vacancy
- Increasing rental percentage
- Little permit activity

### Investment Strategy

Demographic trends inform strategy:

**Fix & Flip Markets:**
- Growing population
- Rising home values
- Low days on market
- Strong employment

**Buy & Hold Markets:**
- Stable population
- High renter percentage
- Strong rent-to-price ratio
- Employment diversity

## Key Demographic Indicators

### Population Growth Rate

|------|----------------|
| > 2% | Hot market, high competition |
| 1-2% | Strong market |
| 0-1% | Stable market |
| < 0% | Declining market, investigate cause |

### Owner-Occupied Percentage

|------|----------------|
| > 70% | Strong homeowner market, flip-friendly |
| 50-70% | Mixed market, multiple strategies work |
| 30-50% | Rental market, landlord buyers |

### Vacancy Rate

| Rate | Interpretation |
|------|----------------|
| < 3% | Very tight market, limited inventory |

| 7-12% | Buyer's market, more negotiating power |
| > 12% | Oversupply, investigate cause |

### Median Household Income

| Income | Wholesale Strategy |
|--------|-------------------|
| < $35K | Focus on affordable properties |
| $35K-$75K | Sweet spot for wholesaling |
| $75K-$125K | Higher-end flips |
| > $125K | Luxury market, different buyers |

## Data Refresh

Census data updates on varying schedules:

| Data Type | Update Frequency |
|-----------|------------------|
| Decennial Census | Every 10 years (full count) |
