## Demographic Trends

### Gentrification Indicators

**Signs of gentrifying area:**
- Rising median income (faster than city average)
- Declining vacancy rate
- Increasing owner-occupancy
- Rising median home value
- Younger median age

**Opportunity:** Early stage gentrification = value appreciation

### Neighborhood Decline Indicators

**Warning signs:**
- Falling median income
- Rising vacancy rate
- Increasing rental ratio
- Population loss
- Rising poverty rate

**Caution:** Declining areas have exit risk

## Age Demographics

### Age Group Investment Implications

| Age Group | % of Population | Implications |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Under 25 | Varies | Student housing, rentals |
| 25-34 | Key | First-time buyers, rentals |
| 35-54 | Key | Move-up buyers, families |
| 55-64 | Growing | Downsizers, sellers |
| 65+ | Varies | Estate sales, downsizing |

### Senior Population

High senior population areas:
- More estate/probate properties
- Deferred maintenance common
- Long-term ownership = high equity
- Motivated seller potential

## Data Access Levels

### Geographic Levels Available

| Level | Population | Best For |
|-------|------------|----------|
| Block Group | 600-3,000 | Hyperlocal analysis |
| Census Tract | ~4,000 | Neighborhood analysis |
| ZIP Code (ZCTA) | Varies | Market-level analysis |
| City | Varies | Metro comparison |
| County | Varies | Regional trends |
| MSA | 100K+ | Metro area analysis |

### Choosing the Right Level

- **Property analysis:** Census Tract or Block Group
- **Market selection:** ZIP Code or City
- **Regional planning:** County or MSA

## Data Currency

### Update Schedule

| Data Type | Source | Frequency |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Population estimates | Census Bureau | Annual (July) |
| ACS data | American Community Survey | Annual (Dec) |
| Decennial Census | Full count | Every 10 years |

### Using ACS vs Decennial

- **ACS (annual):** Best for current estimates, income, housing
- **Decennial:** Most accurate population, but only every 10 years

### Margin of Error

ACS data has margins of error:
- Smaller geographies = higher error
- Income data = higher error than population
- Always check MOE for small areas
