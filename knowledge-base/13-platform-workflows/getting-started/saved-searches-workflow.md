# Saved Searches Workflow

## Overview

Saved searches let you store your search criteria and re-run them whenever you want. Build a library of targeted searches for different investment strategies.

## Creating a Saved Search

### Step 1: Build Your Search

First, create a search with your desired criteria.

**Example prompt:**
"Find absentee owner properties in Miami-Dade County with at least 40% equity, 3+ bedrooms, under $350,000"

### Step 2: Save the Search

Once you have results, save the criteria.

**Example prompts:**
- "Save this search as 'Miami High Equity Absentee'"
- "Save these search criteria"
- "Create a saved search called 'Tampa Investment Leads'"

### Step 3: Confirm and Organize

The AI will confirm your saved search with details:
- Search name
- Criteria saved
- Estimated result count
- Category/folder (if applicable)

## Managing Saved Searches

### View All Saved Searches

**Example prompts:**
- "Show my saved searches"
- "List all my search criteria"
- "What searches have I saved?"

### Run a Saved Search

**Example prompts:**
- "Run my 'Miami High Equity Absentee' search"
- "Execute the Tampa Investment Leads search"
- "Show results from my saved search"

### Modify a Saved Search

**Example prompts:**
- "Update 'Miami High Equity Absentee' to include condos"
- "Change the price limit on my Tampa search to $400,000"
- "Add out-of-state owner filter to my saved search"

### Delete a Saved Search

**Example prompts:**
- "Delete the 'Old Criteria' saved search"
- "Remove my outdated searches"

## Saved Search Organization

### Naming Conventions

Use clear, descriptive names:

| Good Names | Why |
|------------|-----|
| "Miami 3BR Absentee Under 300k" | Specific criteria in name |
| "Tampa-High-Equity-SFR" | Clear category |
| "Phoenix-Tired-Landlord" | Strategy-based |

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| "Search 1" | Not descriptive |
| "Good Properties" | Too vague |
| "Test" | Not useful long-term |

### Organizing by Strategy

Create searches for each investment strategy:

**Fix & Flip:**
- "[City] High Equity Vacant"
- "[City] Tired Landlord"
- "[City] Failed Listing"

**Buy & Hold:**
- "[City] Landlord Exit"
- "[City] Multi-Family Absentee"
- "[City] Low Equity Distressed"

**Wholesale:**
- "[City] High Motivation"
- "[City] Quick Flip Candidates"
- "[City] Probate/Estate"

## Advanced Saved Search Features

### Combining Searches

**Example prompt:**
"Combine my Miami and Tampa searches into a 'South Florida Leads' search"

### Creating Variations

**Example prompt:**
"Create variations of my Miami search for Orlando, Tampa, and Jacksonville"

### Setting Alerts

**Example prompt:**
"Alert me when new properties match my 'Miami High Equity' search"

See [Automated Alerts Workflow](automated-alerts-workflow) for details.

## Best Practices

### Start with Broad, Refine Later
```
1. Create: "Miami All Properties"
2. Refine: "Miami SFR Under 400k"
3. Target: "Miami SFR High Equity Absentee Under 400k"
```

### Maintain Multiple Search Types

| Search Type | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Broad market | Monitor overall inventory |
| Targeted criteria | Find specific opportunities |
| Hot leads | Highest motivation properties |
| Buyer match | Properties for specific buyers |

### Regular Review

Weekly:
- Run your main saved searches
- Review result counts (changes indicate market shifts)
- Update criteria as market changes

Monthly:
- Delete unused searches
- Add searches for new target areas
- Refine criteria based on deal flow

## Example Saved Search Library

A complete saved search setup might include:

```
📁 Miami Market
  ├── Miami-All-SFR (broad)
  ├── Miami-High-Equity-Absentee (targeted)
  ├── Miami-Out-of-State-Owner (targeted)
  └── Miami-Hot-Leads (high motivation)

📁 Tampa Market

## Troubleshooting

**Q: My saved search returns different results each time?**
A: Property data updates weekly. New properties may appear, sold properties drop off.

**Q: Can I share saved searches with my team?**
A: Yes, use "Share this search with [team member]" or export criteria.

**Q: How many searches can I save?**
A: No practical limit. Organize well to keep them manageable.
