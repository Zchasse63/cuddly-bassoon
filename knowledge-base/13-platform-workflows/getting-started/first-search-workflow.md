# Your First Property Search

## Overview

This workflow guides you through performing your first property search using the platform's AI assistant. Learn how to find investment opportunities by combining location, property criteria, and motivation indicators.

## Step 1: Start with a Simple Search

Begin with a basic search to understand the results format.

**Example prompts:**
- "Find properties in Miami, FL"
- "Search for single-family homes in zip code 33139"
- "Show me properties in Dallas"

**What you'll get:**
- List of properties matching your location
- Basic property details (beds, baths, sqft)
- Owner information when available
- Estimated values

## Step 2: Add Property Criteria

Narrow results with property characteristics.

**Example prompts:**
- "Find 3-bedroom homes in Atlanta under $200,000"
- "Search for properties with at least 2 bathrooms in Tampa"
- "Show me homes built before 1990 in Jacksonville"

**Available criteria:**
- Bedrooms (min/max)
- Bathrooms (min/max)
- Square footage (min/max)
- Year built (min/max)
- Property type (single-family, multi-family, condo)
- Price range

## Step 3: Add Motivation Filters

Find sellers more likely to accept below-market offers.

**Example prompts:**
- "Find absentee owner properties in Houston"
- "Search for high-equity properties in Phoenix"
- "Show me properties where owner lives out of state"

**Key motivation indicators:**
- **Absentee owner**: Owner doesn't live at property
- **High equity**: 40%+ equity in the property
- **Long ownership**: Owned 10+ years (more equity)
- **Out-of-state owner**: Owner in different state

## Step 4: Combine Multiple Criteria

Create targeted searches combining all factors.

**Example prompts:**
- "Find absentee owner properties in Miami with at least 50% equity, 3 bedrooms, under $300k"
- "Search for single-family homes in zip 30318 where the owner has lived there more than 15 years"
- "Show me properties in Orlando owned by out-of-state LLCs"

## Step 5: Review and Analyze Results

Once you have results, dig deeper on promising properties.

**Next steps:**
- "Analyze the deal for [property address]"
- "What's the motivation score for the first property?"
- "Show me comparables for this property"

## Tips for Better Searches

### Start Broad, Then Narrow
Begin with location only, then add criteria one at a time to understand what's available.

### Use Multiple Searches
Run several searches with different criteria to build a pipeline of opportunities.

### Save Good Searches
When you find criteria that work, save the search to run again later.

### Check Multiple Areas
Don't limit yourself to one ZIP code. Search neighboring areas for more opportunities.

## Common Questions

**Q: How many results should I expect?**
A: Initial searches may return 50-100+ properties. Add filters to narrow to 10-20 best opportunities.

**Q: Why do some properties show "Unknown" owner?**
A: Some records lack owner data. These may still be good opportunities - just harder to contact.

**Q: How current is the data?**
A: Property records update weekly. Valuations update monthly.
