# Managing Your Buyer Network

## Overview

A strong buyer list is essential for wholesaling success. This workflow covers building, organizing, and leveraging your buyer network to close deals quickly.

## Stage 1: Adding Buyers

### From Networking
Add buyers you meet at REI events, auctions, or through referrals.

**Example prompts:**
- "Add a new buyer named John Smith, cash buyer, interested in Miami"
- "Create a buyer profile for ABC Investments LLC"

### From Deal Activity
Track buyers who express interest in your deals.

**Example prompts:**
- "Add this buyer who inquired about my property"
- "Record buyer interest from today's showing"

### Required Information

| Field | Why It Matters |
|-------|---------------|
| Name/Company | Identification |
| Phone | Primary contact method |
| Email | Deal alerts |
| Buying Criteria | For matching |
| Proof of Funds | Qualification |

## Stage 2: Qualifying Buyers

Not all buyers are equal. Tier them based on quality.

**Example prompts:**
- "Analyze buyer activity for my network"
- "Score buyer fit for John Smith"
- "Which buyers are most active?"

### Buyer Tiers

| Tier | Criteria | Treatment |
|------|----------|-----------|
| A | Verified POF, multiple closes, fast responder | First call on deals |
| B | Some history, good communication | Second tier notification |
| C | New buyer, unverified | Nurture, build relationship |

### Qualification Checklist

- [ ] Proof of funds verified
- [ ] Buying criteria documented
- [ ] Previous transaction history confirmed
- [ ] Response time acceptable
- [ ] Closing ability verified

## Stage 3: Documenting Preferences

Detailed preferences enable accurate matching.

**Example prompts:**
- "Update buyer preferences for John Smith"
- "Record that ABC Investments wants 3-4 unit properties"

### Preference Categories

**Location:**
- Target cities/ZIP codes
- Acceptable radius
- Areas to avoid

**Property Type:**
- Single-family
- Multi-family (2-4 units)
- Multi-family (5+ units)
- Commercial

**Investment Strategy:**
- Fix and flip
- Buy and hold
- BRRRR
- Development

**Financial:**
- Price range (min/max)
- Required ROI
- Maximum rehab budget

## Stage 4: Matching Buyers to Deals

When you have a deal, find the right buyers.

**Example prompts:**
- "Find buyers for this property"
- "Match buyers to 123 Main Street"
- "Who wants a 3-bed flip in Miami under $200k?"

### Match Score Factors

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Location match | 30% |
| Property type match | 25% |
| Price range match | 20% |
| Buyer tier | 15% |
| Past activity | 10% |

## Stage 5: Buyer Communication

Efficient communication closes deals.

**Example prompts:**
- "Suggest buyer outreach for this deal"
- "Who should I notify about my new contract?"
- "Prioritize buyer contacts for this week"

### Communication Best Practices

**New Deal Alerts:**
1. Tier A buyers get personal calls
2. Tier B buyers get immediate email
3. Tier C buyers get deal blast

**Response Tracking:**
- Track who views property details
- Note expressed interest
- Follow up with non-responders

## Stage 6: Analyzing Buyer Network

Understand your network's strengths and gaps.

**Example prompts:**
- "Generate a buyer network report"
- "Identify gaps in my buyer list"
- "Which buyers have closed the most deals?"

### Key Metrics

- **Total buyers**: Network size
- **Active buyers**: Buyers who've responded in 30 days
- **Tier distribution**: % in each tier
- **Geographic coverage**: Areas you can serve
- **Property type coverage**: Deal types you can move

### Identifying Gaps

**Example prompts:**
- "What types of buyers am I missing?"
- "Analyze buyer gaps"
- "What should I focus on when recruiting?"

Common gaps:
- Specific geographic areas
- Multi-family buyers
- High-end flip buyers
- Land buyers

## Stage 7: Nurturing Buyer Relationships

Maintain relationships between deals.

**Example prompts:**
- "Recommend actions for my buyer list"
- "Which buyers need re-engagement?"
- "Track preference changes for my buyers"

### Nurturing Activities

- Share market updates
- Forward relevant (non-competing) deals
- Check in on active projects
- Request referrals from satisfied buyers

## Buyer Red Flags

Watch for these warning signs:

| Red Flag | Risk | Action |
|----------|------|--------|
| Can't verify funds | May not close | Request proof |
| Slow response | Delays closing | Move down tier |
| Multiple fall-throughs | Unreliable | Demote or remove |
| Excessive renegotiation | Deal killer | Note in profile |
| License issues | Legal risk | Verify credentials |
