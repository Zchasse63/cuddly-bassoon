# Deal Pipeline Management

## Overview

When a lead becomes a serious opportunity, it moves from the lead pipeline to the deal pipeline. This workflow covers analyzing, tracking, and closing wholesale deals.

## Stage 1: Converting Lead to Deal

When a seller is interested, create a deal record.

**Example prompts:**
- "Create a deal for 123 Main Street"
- "Convert this lead to a deal"
- "Start a deal for the property at [address]"

### What Gets Created

A deal record includes:
- Property information (from lead)
- Initial offer amount
- Target assignment fee
- Timeline expectations
- Key dates

## Stage 2: Deal Analysis

Run comprehensive analysis before making an offer.

**Example prompts:**
- "Analyze this deal"
- "Calculate MAO for 123 Main Street with $30k in repairs"
- "What's the profit potential on this property?"

### Analysis Components

1. **ARV Estimate**: What it's worth after repairs
2. **Repair Estimate**: Cost to renovate
3. **MAO Calculation**: Maximum you can offer
4. **Profit Analysis**: Expected assignment fee
5. **Risk Assessment**: Red flags and concerns

## Stage 3: Making Offers

Use analysis to craft your offer.

**Example prompts:**
- "What offer should I make on this property?"
- "Calculate optimal offer price"
- "Generate offer scenarios for this deal"

### Offer Strategy

| Scenario | Offer Formula | Use When |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| Aggressive | MAO - 10% | Strong competition |
| Standard | MAO | Normal situation |
| Conservative | MAO - 15% | Risk factors present |

## Stage 4: Deal Stages

Track deals through your pipeline.

**Deal Stages:**

| Stage | Description | Key Actions |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Prospect | Initial interest | Analyze, prepare offer |
| Offer Made | Offer submitted | Follow up, negotiate |
| Under Contract | Contract signed | Due diligence, find buyer |
| Buyer Assigned | Buyer found | Prepare for closing |
| Closing | In escrow | Coordinate with title |
| Closed | Deal complete | Collect fee, celebrate |
| Dead | Deal fell through | Document why |

## Stage 5: Finding Buyers

Once under contract, match to buyers.

**Example prompts:**
- "Find buyers for this deal"
- "Match buyers to the property at 123 Main Street"
- "Who in my buyer list wants this type of property?"

### Buyer Matching Criteria

The system matches based on:
- Location preferences
- Property type preferences
- Price range
- Investment strategy (flip, hold, BRRRR)

## Stage 6: Closing Coordination

Track closing progress.

**Example prompts:**
- "Update deal stage to closing"
- "What's the status of my deals in closing?"
- "Set closing date for deal XYZ"

### Closing Checklist

- [ ] Buyer earnest money received
- [ ] Title work ordered
- [ ] Inspections complete (if required)
- [ ] Assignment agreement signed
- [ ] Closing date confirmed
- [ ] Wire instructions confirmed

## Stage 7: Post-Close Analysis

Learn from completed deals.

**Example prompts:**
- "Generate report for completed deals this month"
- "What was my average assignment fee this quarter?"
- "Analyze my deal conversion rate"

### Key Metrics

- **Deal Volume**: Number of deals closed
- **Total Revenue**: Sum of assignment fees
- **Average Fee**: Revenue per deal
- **Conversion Rate**: Deals closed / offers made
- **Time to Close**: Average days from contract to close

## Deal Scoring

Each deal gets a score (1-10) based on:

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Profit margin | 25% |
| Seller motivation | 25% |
| Market conditions | 20% |
| Property condition | 15% |
| Buyer demand | 15% |

**Score interpretation:**
- 8-10: Strong deal, pursue aggressively
- 6-7: Good deal, worth pursuing
- 4-5: Marginal deal, proceed cautiously
- Below 4: Weak deal, consider passing

## Red Flags in Deals

Watch for these warning signs:

- **Title Issues**: Liens, encumbrances, ownership disputes
- **Unrealistic Seller Expectations**: Wants retail price
- **Major Repairs**: Beyond typical scope
- **Market Decline**: Area values falling
- **Legal Issues**: Code violations, lawsuits
