# Managing Your Lead Pipeline

## Overview

The CRM tools help you organize, prioritize, and track leads through your wholesale pipeline. This workflow covers the lead lifecycle from initial discovery to closed deal.

## Stage 1: Adding Leads

### From Property Search
After searching for properties, add promising ones to your pipeline.

**Example prompts:**
- "Add this property to my leads"
- "Create a lead for 123 Main Street"
- "Save these search results as leads"

### From Manual Entry
Add leads from other sources (driving for dollars, direct mail responses).

**Example prompts:**
- "Create a new lead for John Smith at 456 Oak Ave, Miami FL"
- "Add a lead with phone number (555) 123-4567"

## Stage 2: Organizing with Lists

Create lists to group related leads.

**Example prompts:**
- "Create a lead list called 'Miami Absentee Owners'"
- "Add these leads to my hot leads list"
- "Show me all my lead lists"

### Suggested List Organization

| List Name | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Hot Leads | High motivation, ready to contact |
| Follow-Up Needed | Contacted, needs follow-up |
| Under Contract | Active deals |
| Dead Leads | Not interested/not viable |
| Geographic Lists | By area for driving routes |

## Stage 3: Prioritizing with Motivation Scores

Use motivation scoring to focus on the best opportunities.

**Example prompts:**
- "Rank my leads by motivation score"
- "Show me leads with motivation above 70"
- "Find hot leads in my pipeline"

### Understanding Motivation Scores

| Score | Priority | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 80-100 | Immediate | Call today |
| 60-79 | High | Contact this week |
| 40-59 | Medium | Add to follow-up sequence |
| Below 40 | Low | Nurture or remove |

## Stage 4: Getting Outreach Suggestions

Let the AI suggest which leads to contact next.

**Example prompts:**
- "Suggest leads to contact today"
- "Who should I call first from my Miami list?"
- "Prioritize my outreach for this week"

The AI considers:
- Motivation score
- Time since last contact
- Lead status
- Geographic clustering (for efficiency)

## Stage 5: Tracking Engagement

Record all interactions to track progress.

**Example prompts:**
- "Log a call with the owner of 123 Main Street"
- "Update lead status to 'appointment set'"
- "Track engagement for lead ID xyz"

### Lead Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| New | Just added, not contacted |
| Contacted | Initial outreach made |
| Engaged | Owner responded, conversation started |
| Appointment Set | Meeting scheduled |
| Offer Made | Offer presented |
| Under Contract | Contract signed |
| Closed | Deal completed |
| Dead | Not viable or not interested |

## Stage 6: Analyzing Performance

Review your pipeline performance.

**Example prompts:**
- "Generate a lead pipeline report"
- "Analyze my lead source performance"
- "Which lead sources convert best?"

### Key Metrics to Track

- **Conversion Rate**: Leads → Contracts
- **Source Performance**: Which sources produce best leads
- **Response Rate**: % of leads who respond
- **Average Deal Size**: Revenue per closed deal
- **Time to Close**: Days from lead to contract

## Stage 7: Nurturing Cold Leads

Don't abandon leads too quickly - nurture them over time.

**Example prompts:**
- "Suggest a nurturing plan for lead XYZ"
- "Set up follow-up reminders for my cold leads"
- "Re-engage leads I haven't contacted in 30 days"

### Nurturing Best Practices

1. **Monthly Check-ins**: Brief follow-up calls/texts
2. **Market Updates**: Share relevant market news
3. **Seasonal Timing**: Contact around tax time, year-end
4. **Life Events**: Note and follow up on mentioned events
