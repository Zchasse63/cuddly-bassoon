# Lead Follow-Up Workflow

## Overview

Consistent follow-up converts leads into deals. This workflow covers creating follow-up sequences, tracking touchpoints, and nurturing leads through your pipeline.

## Follow-Up Fundamentals

### The Typical Lead Journey
```
New Lead → Initial Contact → Follow-up 1 → Follow-up 2 →
... → Appointment → Offer → Negotiation → Contract
```

### Follow-Up Statistics
- Average deal requires 5-12 touchpoints
- 80% of deals happen after the 5th contact
- Most investors give up after 2-3 attempts

## Creating Follow-Up Sequences

### Basic Sequence
```
"Create follow-up sequence for new leads:
Day 1: Initial call
Day 3: Follow-up call
Day 7: Email
Day 14: Call
Day 21: Mail piece
Day 30: Final call"
```

### Customize by Lead Source
```
"Create sequences for:
- Hot leads (daily follow-up for 7 days)
- Warm leads (3-day intervals)
- Cold leads (weekly follow-up)"
```

### Customize by Response
```
"If lead answered but not interested:
- Set 30-day follow-up
- Add to long-term nurture

If lead didn't answer:
- Try 3 more times over 10 days
- Then switch to mail/email"
```
