# Map-Based Search Workflow

## Overview

Map tools provide visual property discovery, allowing you to see opportunities geographically and identify patterns not visible in list views.

## Basic Map Search

### Open Map View
```
"Show properties on a map in [location]"
"Open map view for Miami Beach"
```

### Add Property Markers
```
"Show all absentee owner properties on the map"
"Add high-equity properties to the map"
```

## Search by Drawing

### Draw a Search Area
```
"Let me draw a search area on the map"
"I want to define a custom boundary"
```

**Drawing options:**
- Rectangle: Click and drag
- Polygon: Click points to create custom shape
- Circle: Click center, drag for radius

### Search Within Drawing
```
"Find all properties with [criteria] within my drawn area"
```

## Point-Based Search

### Search Around Location
```
"Search for properties within 1 mile of this point"
"Find absentee owners near [address]"
```

### Search Near Landmarks
```
"Find properties within walking distance of [metro station]"
"Show properties near [shopping center]"
```

## Using Map Filters

### Apply Visual Filters
```
"Color code properties by:
- Motivation score
- Equity level
- Property type
- Owner type"
```

### Filter Map Display
```
"Hide properties under $100K"
"Show only 3+ bedroom properties"
"Display only high-motivation leads"
```

## Map Layers

### Available Layers
| Layer | Shows | Use Case |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Properties | Individual properties | Lead identification |
| Heat map | Concentration areas | Pattern recognition |
| Boundaries | ZIP/neighborhood lines | Area definition |
| Comps | Recent sales | Market validation |

### Layer Controls
```
"Show property layer with heat map overlay"
"Toggle neighborhood boundaries on"
"Hide sold properties layer"
```

## Navigating the Map

### Zoom and Pan
```
"Zoom in to [neighborhood]"
"Center map on [address]"
"Show the entire [city/county]"
```

### Saved Views
```
"Save this map view as 'South Beach Target Area'"
"Load my saved 'Tampa Investment Zone' view"
```

## Property Interaction

### Click for Details
```
Click any property marker for:
- Quick property summary
- Owner information
- Estimated value
- Motivation indicators
```

### Property Actions from Map
```
"Analyze this property" (from marker popup)
"Add to my lead list"
"Get more details"
```

## Cluster View

### Understanding Clusters
When zoomed out, properties group into clusters showing:
- Number of properties in area
- Color indicating concentration
- Click to zoom in and see individuals

### Using Clusters
```
"Find areas with highest property concentration"
"Which clusters have the most high-equity properties?"
```

## Multi-Property Selection

### Select Multiple Properties
```
"Select all properties in this area"
"Add all visible properties to my list"
```

### Batch Actions
```
"Analyze all selected properties"
"Skip trace these 20 properties"
"Export selected to spreadsheet"
```

## Street View Integration

### Check Property Visually
```
"Show street view for this property"
"What does the property look like from the street?"
```

### Visual Condition Assessment
Use street view to note:
- Exterior condition
- Landscaping quality
- Neighborhood appearance
- Parking/access

## Map Search Strategies

### The Neighborhood Sweep
```
1. Zoom to target neighborhood
2. Draw boundary around area
3. Filter for motivation criteria
4. Review each property marker
5. Add promising leads to list
```

### The Drive Route Planning
```
1. Show all target properties on map
2. Identify clusters for efficient driving
3. Plan route through highest-density areas
4. Export addresses for GPS
```

### The Expansion Search
```
1. Start with proven successful area
2. Look for similar adjacent areas
3. Compare property characteristics
4. Expand search to promising areas
```

## Map Tips

### Performance
- Don't load too many properties (< 1,000 for smooth operation)
- Use filters to reduce property count
- Zoom in for detailed views

### Analysis
- Look for patterns in property distribution
- Notice neighborhood transitions
- Identify areas of concentration

### Workflow
- Combine with list view for details
- Export map selections for follow-up
- Save favorite views for repeat searches

## Common Map Searches

### Quick Neighborhood Scan
```
"Show all off-market opportunities in [neighborhood] on map"
```

### Competition Check
```
"Show recent investor purchases on map in [area]"
```

### Route Optimization
```
"Show my top 20 leads on map for driving route"
```
